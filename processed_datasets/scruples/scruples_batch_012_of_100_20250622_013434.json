      "title": "AITA for calling out an indie game developer for going on vacation while releasing and charging money for unfinished/unpolished content?",
      "description": "For the record, this happened about 7 months ago, but from what I'm seeing nobody else in the game's community has ever criticized the developer for this, nor has the developer ever acknowledged this.\n\nSo a while back (about 7 months ago, like I said), an indie fighting game I enjoy playing released and update with two new DLC characters for purchase. One was relatively well-polished, perhaps a bit too strong, but it was clear that the developers had tested him rather thoroughly and that he was in a state ready for release. The other... about as polished as 12-grit sandpaper.\n\nIt's hard to go into detail without explicitly revealing the game or the developer, but take my word for it when I say the character was a buggy, unbalanced mess. She had a move that could easily be abused in a way that could kill almost anyone from 0 damage after landing it just once, making it completely overpowered. At the same time, almost every other move she had was incredibly underpowered, making it so that players had no choice but to use the overpowered move if they didn't want to be completely crushed. (Note that this isn't just my opinion; just about everyone, including the people I was arguing against, agree that this character was a complete mess on release day.)\n\nThese were on top of numerous bugs, and even crashes related to the patch as a whole, one in particular making so that one of the most popular adapters for one of the most popular controllers used by the community just *outright stopped working*.\n\nShortly before the update, the lead developer had started a week-long trip to Hawaii with his family. He gave the very small group of beta testers for the game only ONE day to test the second character before she released, whereas the first had been available to them for a few months by that point. This being an indie game, *he* was the one who decided to organize things this way; not any publisher, not some board of directors, just this one guy. Some tired to argue that the developer worked hard and deserved a break, excusing the vacation's timing. While I agree that him taking a vacation is not an issue in of itself, he had total freedom to delay his product as long as he needed in order to finish it, but he chose to shove it out the door right before he'd be gone for a full week. This caused a some significant problems for the other dev team members, as they were unable to start working on a new patch without the lead developer, leaving the players with a buggy mess of a game for over a week.\n\nNow to his credit, the lead developer did get to work on fixing things as soon as he got home from Hawaii, but he was completely silent about the situation. Going through his posts on Twitter, Reddit, and the game's official Discord server, you'd think that the whole thing never happened. The community seemed to just forget the issue as well as soon as the new patch came out a few days later. I'll admit I didn't even think much about it at the time, but now I really wish I had.\n\nAfter taking a break from the game for a few months, I came back and realized the lead developer seemed to have mostly gotten away with this without any real consequences I could see. The character he released was in a much, much better place, and the controller issues had long since been fixed, but I couldn't help but feel that the fact that the developer didn't seem to have anything to say over his decisions didn't seem right to me. The game is not an early access/beta title, but it is still being actively developed, and has a bonus/deluxe edition and Nintendo Switch port coming out sometime next year. In my eyes, because the lead developer sold us unfinished content once and never seemed to show any sort of regret over it it, the community should be skeptical of those future releases and and any other games he makes further down the line, because he can get away with doing it again if people will pay for it anyway.  Now when I tried and tell people in the game's community all this, they defended him and claimed I was being unreasonable.\n\nParaphrased, the arguments they used against me included:\n\n* Because it's been 7 months now, it's no longer relevant to bring up.\n* The issues with the character have been fixed, so it doesn't matter if they were released in a bad state or not.\n* The lead developer has learned his lesson, and the proof is that he has since released another DLC character that was actually finished and much more polished than the previous one.\n* If the lead developer addressed it now, it'd just create a lot unnecessary drama, which will distract him from further improving the game.\n* I'm focusing far too much on the negative and should be grateful for the good things the developer has done.\n* The DLC was only $5, so it's not worth getting worked up over.\n\nAnd my respective counter arguments are:\n\n* The topic is still relevant to the game's continued development and upcoming re-releases. What happened 7 months ago with that highly anticipated character can happen again with the new editions/ports if we let the developers get away with it, and it'll be our money on the line.\n* We were still sold an incomplete character. Even if they're much more polished now, we didn't pay for a polished character six months from release. We paid for a complete character the day it was released.\n* Just because the lead developer released *one* good character after selling us a blatantly unfinished one doesn't mean he learned anything, especially since that particular character is licensed from a third party, so there was more reason to make them not complete garbage at launch in order to stay friendly with the original owners. Unless the developer himself explicitly says he won't do it again, we won't know whether or not he will.\n* If people react badly to what he did, he probably deserves it. It's not right to knowingly sell people a product that isn't finished while pretending that it is finished. And as far as distracting him, I'll bet money that any real conflict caused by an apology would go away after about two weeks at the longest. Honestly, by the end of it he even might get praise for admitting to a poor decision.\n* I focus on the negative because this wasn't just some simple mistake, but a very deliberate decision on the part of the lead developer. It's true that the developer has far more good on his track record than bad, but it was him who decided it was a good idea to release that character as they were and charge his fans for them. If he was willing to do that to people who are so incredibly loyal to him and his game, that gives plenty of reason to be skeptical of his business practices in the future.\n* It's not very expensive, sure, but $5 is still $5. Besides, there's still the moral issue of misleading your customers even if the cost is low. The character was presented as finished in the trailer they made for them, despite that not at all being the case. Regardless of the price, if you take someone's money and don't provide what you said you would, it's not right.\n\nIn the end the debate went nowhere and I was told to just drop it, but I can't but feel baffled by how much these people are defending this developer. I'm pretty sure a more well known studio would get roasted alive over something like this, but people just don't seem to care, or get genuinely upset by the idea of being critical of this developer. Are my arguments valid? Am I the asshole for thinking that we should criticize and be skeptical of the developer?",

      "description": "AITA for not visiting my grandmother in her retirement home?\n\nTLDR: Said my goodbyes to my grandmother a couple of years ago, she pulled through miraculously and is now in a retirement home. Due to a strained relationship I think me visiting will barely mean anything.\n\nHey all, sorry for the long story and for any spelling/grammar mistakes (not a native speaker).\n\nI've (27m) never had a great relationship with my grandmother. I think I've seen her a total of 10 times in the last 20 year. Her and my mom never got along well, and my father isn't one to see his family a lot (sometimes it would even be years where I would not see his side of the family, even though my mom said he should contact them). \n\nAbout 9 years ago I broke off contact with my father (not important why, but I was mostly TA there for placing most of the blame of my parent's divorce on him).\n\n6 years later, my grandmother (his mother) was hospitalized and we were almost certain she wouldn't get out of the hospital alive. I was kinda shocked when my dad called me with the news, especially since we didn't get along that well yet. Anyway, I made arrangements with my brother to visit my grandmother &amp; father. We said our goodbyes (wasn't anything emotional, but she was happy we were there). Eventually my grandmother did get better and got out of the hospital and could even live on her own.\n\nLast year she surprisingly showed up at my brother's wedding, but she was notably older and dementing. She kept confusing me and my brother and kept saying how happy she was for me and how beautiful my girlfriend was. I tried to correct her a couple of times, but eventually gave up and went along with it and so did my gf. It was very awkward for me, even though I realize it was mostly her dementia.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. She was hospitalized again, this time even more serious. She still came out of there alive, but could certainly not take care of herself anymore. My father and aunts decided that it would be better for her to live in a retirement home. Her dementia is now even worse, so on some days she doesn't remember what happened and it takes some time for her to understand what's happening. He did notice that she was visibly more alive when people came and visited her.\n\nThis (finally) brings me to my current problem. On the one hand, I don't feel the need to visit her. I don't have a great connection with her, nor with my father. I also felt like the first goodbye was a nice closure, for me at least, and the wedding was a nice bonus. I also doubt she would recognize me or remember me the next day.\n\nOn the other hand I feel bad, since it is my father's mother. Now, the relationship of me and my father is slowly getting better, but still not how it should be between a father and a son. Me visiting her would maybe not mean much to me, but it could prolong her life/make it a bit nicer, and would be a nice gesture towards my dad.\n\nSoo WIBTA here?\n\nYaay, you made it to the end. Thanks for reading!",

      "description": "Alright, so there's this teacher st my high school, T. He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? ",

      "description": "**TLDR: Asked an old fling out on a date as I'm single and just thought \"Doesn't hurt to ask, maybe she's also single\", her roommate then messages me saying leave her alone and I'm \"interrupting her growth\"...?**    \n \n\n* Here is the exchange with the Fling and I: https://imgur.com/a/3dPm0GX\n\n \n* Here is the exchange with the fling's roommate and I (PD=high school reunion): https://imgur.com/a/4G6kOPc\n\nSome background, I'm a male, 27, studying to be a CFP, own my own home, and own a luxury car (not bragging by any means, but this is why I am so confused at the roommate's accusation) Fling is 22/23F, never went to college and works at an antique mall (no judgement, I've been there!). Fling's roommate is 19ish(?) also never went to college, works in a small kitchen (again, no judgement). Fling and I had a thing for a few weeks, first date SHE made the move to kiss. Later in the week we go to the park and walk around holding hands, make out some more blah blah. Next week we go back to her place, cuddling in bed, one thing leads to another I go down on her only. She's never seen me without a shirt lmao. A day or two later she mentions she can't see me anymore, moving way to fast (even though she made the moves), she's not in the right head space to date or even be physical. Sure no worries, I date a fair amount so I understand. \n\nFlash forward like 2-3 weeks after the falling out, I ask her if she'd like to meet up for a casual date and just see how it feels. \"I can't I'm seeing someone. #wut So almost two weeks ago you can't imagine dating and you freak out and bail, and here you are SEEING someone (I emphasize \"seeing\" as if her and this dude weren't serious she could have gone out and been honest \"I'm actually talking to another guy\" etc). Very strange. But again, whatever, life y'know?\n\nNow the screenshots linked about come into play. There is about a 5mo difference between the \"I'm seeing someone\" and my initial invite to the homecoming event. Also note the roommate messaged me almost 3 HOURS later. So if it was that big of deal why not tell me sooner? \n\nAm I an asshole? I feel blindsided by the roommate's response. Especially the part about me interrupting her growth, while without being cocky, feel like being in a \"better\" life position, would if anything being HELPING her grow. She is literally me 5 years ago: anxiety ridden, no college, working jobs on the \"lower\" end, money crazy tight, etc. I get it! I find(found? lol) her attractive both physically and mentally. I would loved to have been a guiding hand to her finding more and more success. I understand Fling has real bad anxiety, but if she was so distraught could she not just block me? (I am currently unblocked by both btw) \n\nAny advice or insight into what I did wrong and how to better handle myself in the future would be greatly appreciated!",

Stuff hasn't been too great lately, but instead of talking about it, he just ignores the issue and refuses to talk to me at all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I went on our laptop to apply for a few jobs and to do some stuff. I opened up a messaging app to send him a message and he was still logged in and was talking to a particular person who he's talked about me to in the past. Out of interest I opened the chat up and saw they had been discussing me. The messages consisted of how he regretted the puppy we had bought, how he wasn't happy that he'd moved out with me and was hoping that things would improve. His friend never has anything nice to say about me and they both seem to have come to the conclusion that he's only with me because he doesn't want to be alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings haven't been great for a long time, and I'm fully aware of that and that I'm not an easy person to deal with. I just don't understand why he can't talk to me about these things &amp; why I have to find out that he feels like this through going through his messages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I was seeing this guy in college for a little over a year. At the end of my senior year i let him believe I was going to grad school in a different city. \n\nWhen we met it was at at a bar one night. We hit it off pretty well and we started hanging out a lot after. It started off as just to have sex but then I started coming over so we could just hang out. We’d go out for lunch and do little stuff together but it was still strictly a FWB thing. \n\nThen summer break happened and I didn’t see him for 3 months. We didn’t really stay in contact we just snapped each other and towards the end of the break we started to face time more. When we got back to school we immediately picked up where we left off. \n\nThings progressed and the relationship got more serious. But then he told me he had sex with someone else. I was hurt but we never talked about being exclusive. It wasn’t agreed but still out of respect and cause I didn’t really want to I never hooked up with anyone else. Still I forgave him and continued to see him. We agreed that moving forward we would be exclusive.\n\nI wondered why we weren’t officially a couple when he told me that since he aren’t of the same religion he’s scared to take me home to his family. Doesn’t mean he won’t ever but he says as of right now he’s only comfortable with his friends and sister knowing about me and that we hang out a lot. \n\nThis didn’t sit that well with me cause I was worried that maybe that was an excuse and he really just didn’t want to make it official with me cause he knew we probably didn’t have a future together. But I enjoyed spending time with him. He had become a great friend and I didn’t wanna let that go yet. \n\nWell he told me that he was planning on staying in the same city to complete his undergrad. I told him that I thought I was gonna go to a different city. And for a while I felt that way. I told friends and family that I was planning on going to the school in the different city. Then last minute I changed my mind and I told everyone but him. \n\nSo the past few months we have been in the same city and he didn’t know. We are 15 minutes from each other.  I ran into his friend on campus and I know he told him I was in town because now he won’t stop calling me. \n\nSo before I talk to him I guess I wanna know if I’m the asshole. When I ask my friends I know I get a biased answer because they saw how hurt I was so they obviously thing He deserves lworse.\n",

      "title": "AITA for not believing the girl I'm seeing about something petty she said she didn't do and making it a big deal?",
      "description": "Ok this one is a little complicated but I've tried my best to explain it. \n\nI've been seeing this girl for a couple months now so I know her pretty well but not completely. Basically, my girlfriend at this point but we haven't made it official. \n\nI'm back home visiting my family so the other day, I sent her a picture of me and my cousins hangin out, expecting her to say something like \"aw that's a cute pic\". But she proceeds to nitpick something about the picture, the details of which are not important to the story. I was a bit annoyed saying these little details she's nitpicking on aren't important, just focus on me and my cousins. This wasn't such a big deal to me, these things happen. \n\nHowever, she said she did say it was a cute pic. So I scrolled up thinking I missed her comment but I saw no such message. I took a screenshot of her non-message and sent it to her. I was expecting her to send a screenshot as well with her message but she didn't. So I asked her to send a screenshot of her message cause I just had to see it for myself. I know it's not really trusting of me to ask that instead of just taking her word for it but that's what I did. She ignores it completely and keeps on with the convo. I asked her again about the screenshot and this time, she seems or acts confused. I told her I asked for a screenshot and she said that she didn't get that message and sent me a screenshot with that message missing. At this point, alarm bells are going off in my head. Is it possible that she deleted the message I sent asking for the screenshot, took a screenshot after that and sent it to me? How is it possible that two very convenient crucial messages didn't go through? One supposedly that she sent that didn't go through (her saying it was a cute pic) and another one that I sent asking for the screenshot. By the way, the message that I sent asking for the screenshot is showing up as 'Seen' so she MUST have seen it right? \n\nI called her out on this and she was shocked and completely plead ignorance. She said her phone's been acting up and that I should believe her over a phone. I should also say that I'm overseas and my internet connection is not very fast. I pressed her a bit more about sending me a screenshot of her initial message and she finally sent it to me. The message that she said she sent (cute pic) wasn't in it. And then she said that's probably because it didn't go through or that maybe she typed it out and didn't actually press send, which sounded like complete bs to me. So after a back and forth of asking her to admit it and her not admitting it and sticking to her story, we're pretty much at a stalemate and still fighting about it. I know it sounds like I'm the one being petty here but the evidence against her is there. I don't put anything past anybody and I feel like people are capable of anything. I had an ex, for example, who would log into my fb account and look at my messages. It might not be fair to compare this girl to that ex but I can't help but operate on my history. Part of me wants to believe her but there is clearly another much bigger part that simply can't let this go. AITA?",

      "description": "I’ve (28M) been dating this girl (21F) for about 5 months and last night she completely freaked out on me. \n\nSome context: I’m currently working a really demanding job as a lawyer and she’s finishing her undergrad and works part-time. We met on tinder and saw each other only for sex for the first 2 months or so. Then one night we were meant to hang out but a friend who was leaving the country called and asked to hang out so I told her we could hang out for a bit then I’d go drinking with my buddy and she completely flipped out. She told me it was rude and left my place pretty angry. I thought we were done\n\nA month or so later I messaged her and we hooked up again. After that we saw each other once a month or so. She’s a cool girl and I can tell she really likes me because she’d check in on me and send me supportive messages and I started to like her back. The thing is I’m really busy at work in the week and on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends to blow off some steam. Anyway, here’s where it started: she would send me messages telling me that she wanted me to put in more effort if we were gonna continue to see each other. \n\nWe argued about this back and forth but still hung out and she was still supportive. We hung out a few more times and actually spoke and it was really nice. Then last weekend I told her I would take her out after she complained about me not putting in effort. She then sent me a message saying she couldn’t do it anymore and she didn’t want to date someone she felt like she had to nag to hang out with her. \n\nHere’s the moment: we went on the date and it was a nice evening and we chatted. Afterwards she asked me what we were gonna do after (I told her I had to be up early but we could go hang out at my place). When it was time to leave o told her I’d drop her off at her house on my way home (I was tired because I had drinks at work before the date and she knew this). I think she was upset because she said that it was fine she’d call her own Uber home. \n\nI then told her that it was fine she could come over. She asked me if I was sure and that she could just go home. I called the Uber and she asked if she should go home again then I joke “no it’s fine, I don’t want to wake up to 120 messages in the morning” and she went kind of silent. Then when we got to my place I was on my phone for a bit and she commented that it was rude to be on your phone in front of company and I joked that I was checking things for worked and sent a few messages and then put it down. She then completely lost it. She went off on me about how she feels like she has to nag me to want to spend time with her and so on. She then left my place really upset (she was crying). \n\nI said I was sorry even though I don’t think I did anything wrong but she wasn’t happy with that and she messaged me the next day saying that what I did was hurtful and I told her to calm down and then we could speak. She said this was rude and dismissive and I told her I had nothing to say then. She called me all teary and we ended things and she’s now blocked me. ",

She hides food from me and gets angry if I eat anything that someone else may have wanted to eat and has called me a \"fat bitch\" for eating the last muffin once. She insists I buy my own food (which she then \"borrows\" and then calls me selfish for buying it for myself.). She has made several comments to my dad about how he \"cant afford to take care of me\" and how it \"isnt his responsibility\" (even when I was under 18, she would insist that I go live with my mom instead). I can't even stomach the thought of seeing her on such an important day In my life, she has made the last few years of mine miserable and seeing her would ruin it for me. I was thinking of just inviting my dad but specifying that she was not invited, and then letting him know that if he insisted she go then neither of them would be welcome at the ceremony, and then just having my mom walk me down the isle. Is this wrong? Is it an ass move?",

      "description": "Some context, my (28m) fiance (27f) has had health issues which left her in a lot of pain and unable to move around much at all for the majority of 2018. I had picked up the slack and would do the dishes, laundry, taking out the garbage and other miscellaneous tasks. It took a toll on me and we would have constant fights back then to which I admit I may have been at fault back then. Regardless though she always exclaimed that after getting better the first few things she wanted to start doing again was helping with the chores.\n\nThe thing is now that she's had surgery and fully recovered here I was expecting things to shift back to normal where it would be a little more evenly split between us yet here I am still doing all of these things 90% (laundry100% of the time)of the time, my main issue being the laundry. We live in an apartment and need to walk up two flights of stairs to reach the laundry room. When I slack off because I'm tired after work it can really pile up. \n\nThings really started to build up and get to me,  we have been fighting quite consistently the previous weeks. I had been asking her to please not wait for the garbage bin to be so full you can't close it before taking it out( small apartment with open garbage bins don't work). Well that continued and then the same day she actually decided to do the laundry but ended forgetting it downstairs and blamed me for not reminding her, I had apparently agreed to keep track but I did not hear this request as I had my head phones at that time. So this turns into a larger argument.\n\nI feel she doesn't follow through with what she says all the time and I feel lied to. Her argument though is that she appreciates what I do for her but she forgets and these things shouldn't be an issue. I've been trying really hard to see things from her point of view but it just never feels like she understands why I get upset. \n\nTL;DR : Fiance promised to help out with chores after recovering but that fell through and I still end up doing it.   Doesn't think I should make a big deal out it when we fight ",

      "description": "I'm supposed to be staying at a friends house for five days. I'm on day two and I'm really freaking out. To preface this story, I must say that I have some slight obsessive tendencies and I really struggle with a lack of cleanliness.\n\nMy friend and her mum have a tiny little terrier who's quite elderly and doesn't have the best control over its bodily functions. In the last 24hrs I've dodged multiple piles of poop and piddle and while they do their best to clean up, there's smelly stains and old streaks of dried poop everywhere. This dog will shit everywhere and then come and sit on me and lick me and lick everyone and everything and then we all sit down to share food and they haven't washed their hands and it's all a bit too overwhelming. I constantly feel sick and want to scrub my whole body down and change my clothing which of course is impractical as I have limited clothing on me.\n\nI am well known to them as an avid animal lover so I can't just ask them to keep the dog away from me as it'd be considered out of character. And her mum's self concious enough about her house at it is without me being honest about why I'm leaving (if I do) so I was considering saying I'm feeling unwell and training back to mine (I live a 2hr train journey away). There's just no way I can be polite about it (or so I can think).\n\nI fear I'm maybe the arsehole because I have exams coming up and I accepted the holiday invitation out of politeness. I do just want to be at home to cram, and this is a factor in my desire to leave, but this situation is really feeling like a dealbreaker for me. As much as I care about my friend, i want to make my excuses and leave...",

      "title": "AITA for telling my parents to consider their needs before adopting nephews?",
      "description": "Names have been changed.\n\nVarious family members were down on hard times and because my parents worked so hard to provide for me and my brothers they were also able to provide for extended family that needed help. Because they have the biggest hearts, and the means to help, they immediately offered their arms and their home to whoever happened to need them.\n\nSince the early 90's my parents were taking in family. They believed God gave them the ability to help so they should do so. No one paid rent. No one said thank you. But that was not why my parents helped. They weren't interested in clout or rent money... only in helping whoever needed them, whenever they were needed, and that was often.\n\nIn '11 My father's adult neice Barbara (his sister Denise's daughter) and her husband Gabriel and their two young kids Eric (6) and Ethan (2) needed particular help. The family of four moved in with us five. They stayed in our semi-converted garage and paid rent when they could. In the few years they lived with us, Gabriel and my oldest brother battled a heroine addiction. Barbara was in and out of work. Eric and Ethan didn't go to school.\n\nThey stayed with us for almost two years and in that time, I witnessed more verbal assault between Barbara and Gabriel than I knew possible. Police had come multiple times to the house.... the poor boys never knew structure or consistency. \n\nOne night was especially bad. Barbara and Gabriel were caught in a shouting match, their boys crying on the couch. For the first time in her life, my mom had enough. She had the most patience of any one I've ever known and they drained her of it. She let them know that the violence was not okay, and they would have to leave if they couldn't control themselves in front of their kids.\n\nIn the next couple weeks they were gone. In the next couple years they were worse. Gabriel fought and lost his battle with addiction repeatedly. Barbara fell victim to the same drug abuse. They went from couch to couch. Often, Barbara and Eric would stay with Denise. Denise is an especially heartless person who would not welcome Gabriel or Ethan into her home. Gabirel was not Eric's biological father, so Denise was more welcoming of Eric than young Ethan.\n\nGabriel and Ethan would spend some nights on the streets. Some nights on our couch. Ethan has some language setbacks that hasn't been helped by his lack of structure or time in school. Over the years since they moved out my parents have helped get the boys in school, and get Barbara work, and get both Barbara and Gabriel in rehab. Time after time they abuse my parents' willingness to help, and time after time they are not willing to help themselves and continue to put them and their children in dangerous situations.\n\nThe most recent situation involves Barbara getting arrested after an altercation in Denise's home about a week ago. Child Protective Services took Ethan after Denise was willing to take Eric and not Ethan. Ethan is now in custody of the state at a childrens center. And Denise is planning on sending Eric to live with his biological father, a man he's never met, in Colorado. Denise wants nothing to do with Barbara or her grandchildren. Barbara is now in the streets with Gabriel.\n\nBarbara has called my father pleading for him to take Ethan. Not just out of the childrens center, but into his home and raise him as his own. She pleads to her uncle (my father) saying that he and my mom have always done right, and worked hard. She tells them that they've been able to provide for me and my brothers and raise half-decent men. She wants the same for her son, and knows that she can't provide it and that he wont get it from the state's foster system.\n\nAnd so ensues the current situation that is weighing so heavily on my parents hearts. All they have ever known is welcoming others into their home. They are actually more financially able to help others now than ever before. However, they are undoubtedly tired. My parents are fifty and this boy is seven years old. Is they adopt Ethan, they are committing to another 10/15 years of parenting. They would be starting all over. Not only this, but they would also take in Eric without second thought. They are now discussing taking in 7 year old Ethan and 11 year old Eric, and raising these boys and showing them love and structure and meaning like they've never known before. They feel like this is their duty, regardless of the fact that theyll be 60 when Ethan graduates from highschool and they finally have a chance to breathe for the first time in their lives.\n\nAlso in this time, my mom's cousin John has moved back in with my parents who now help raise his daughter Melina. Melina's mother is Tyra, my father's other niece (Barbara's sister and Denise second daughter). This only complicates the situation further. \n\nMy parents know this is not their cross to carry... the boys have parents and a grandparent. But none of them are either able to or care to provide for the boys. So my parents feel responsible to carry that cross. I tell them they have already done more work for others than is expected in one lifetime... yet they are still called to help.\n\nThey are obvioisly hesitant to take on the commitment of raising two boys again for another ten years... but arent sure if they can live with knowing that the boys are either in foster care or in Colorado with strangers if they say no.\n\nWhat is the right thing to do here? Have they done more than their fair share for loved ones who have already drained every ounce of help from them? Or do they have a responsiblity to take care of these children who need help, regardless of it being their duty or not?\n\nTl;dr-\nMy parents have taken in various extended family, rent free, for the last thirty years, including neice+her husband+2kids. Now niece and her husband are on the streets, losing a battle with drug abuse, and their children are displaced. They've asked my able-but-tired parents to adopt the children. My parents want to help but are understandably concerned about the huge commitment and responsibility. Whats the right thing to do?",

      "description": "In February it's been a year since our mom died of lung cancer. I had seen her a few weeks before and I could tell her time was coming. I live in California, my brother in Nebraska, our mom in Arizona. \n\nI'm single, have a good paying job, flexible to work wherever so I was our moms caretaker during chemo. I paid for a lot of things like food, medicine, rent at times until my mom got full disability. Her treatment was completely covered by the state. \n\nMy brother is married, has 2 kids at home, one kid elsewhere who he pays child support for and his wife has a kid elsewhere. I assume they live well enough, they tell me they like shopping at whole foods because you can grab a beer and carry it around. They have family vacations every year in Colorado with his wife's side. Me and my mom were never invited, there is a past here with his wife being controlling and jealous from the start. \n\nSo I tell my brother mom doesn't have much longer you guys need to come visit. He tells me they don't know how they can afford tickets for everyone, he just had expensive knee surgery, so after some back and forth I offer to cover it. He and his wife both swear convincingly they will set up a payment plan with me. I buy my brother, his wife and their 4 kids tickets mostly so my mom can say goodbye to her grandkids. This comes out of my savings it puts me in no financial hardship. \n\nMy aunts help get my mom set up with hospice at home. So we all go back to our homes. I have to pack some stuff, grab my 2 cats, drop them off with my friend in LA then drive back to be there when my mom takes her final breath. My brother of course wants to be there but refuses to come without his wife. At this time the stress of anticipating losing my mom consumes me and I tell him fine I'll buy you guys 2 more tickets. \n\nMy mom dies peacefully with just us 3 by her side. I'm actually relieved my brother and his wife are there because I become a zombie. His wife cooks for us, my brother makes arrangements for belongings. We make some money from selling the things my mom told us to sell, split that money because my brother and his wife had to drive back home with some furniture and stuff in a rented SUV. We tally up everything they owe me on paper and they promise to pay me back monthly. \n\nTo this day they have given me nothing. I gently bring it up the first few weeks after. They say we can't yet we will let you know and seem very annoyed. I bring it up again a few months later, same reply. They decide to move to Arizona a few months after our mom has died which confuses me. Why couldn't they have done this when she needed help? Now they say we can't pay you we just moved. So I wait until end of the year, when I'm buying a house and say I could really use a little extra help now that I have a mortgage, his reply don't worry we haven't forgotten about you. Honestly though I don't really need their money to get by but it bothers me so bad that my brother scammed me. I have been very respectful when asking for the money back but I really want to demand it and call him out for being a liar. I know this will accomplish nothing so I say nothing to instigate. \n\nI feel like a total a-hole, not the rude kind, the dumb kind. I have learned never to lend anyone money that I'm not completely content in never getting back...",

      "description": "I'm 19F &amp; the only one living with my parents, who work long hours, so my mom likes to book an appointment for a deep tissue back massage every so often. She asked me to drive her to her appt, which is in another city about 45 min. away. We planned to visit her sister on the way back since we'd be in town. I agree, &amp; so we made the plan for the 2 of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen about 20 min. before we leave for the appt., my dad comes home from work. He asks where we're going, &amp; we tell him about the appt. We keep in mind he is very tired from work, but he insists on driving us. We initially refuse, since we made these plans for us &amp; didn't want to deal with his post-work crabbiness, but since he kept insisting, he ended up driving us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalfway through the drive, he says \"(my mom's name), I love you but don't you think I get tired from driving you to these appointments?\" My mom &amp; I are quiet, astounded that he made it seem like we forced him to go when we both knew it was supposed to be just us. I'm usually outspoken towards my parents but I didn't want to further aggravate him, but I was fuming inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the appt, we vist my aunt. I was too mad &amp; finally called him out. I said something like, \"Dad, you didn't have to drive us, we didn't even ask you &amp; you made it seem like you FORCED you but we didn't. You could've just stayed home, no one invited you. She's the mother of your children, she's put up with you for over 20 years, don't you think she deserves some self-care? You don't even appreciate what she does for us!\" I was near tears, he was quiet. My cousins &amp; aunt were awkwardly sitting nearby, &amp; after the silence everything proceeded as normal with some tension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I get into a fight with either of my parents, we forget or act like it hasn't happened by the next day or just avoid each other until we're over it. The car ride home was quiet &amp; I listened to music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day my dad confronted me, saying he didn't like the way I addressed him in front of our family like that, that it could've waited til we were alone. I said had I confronted him in our own home, he wouldn't have given my words a 2nd thought. It's true my mom works hard &amp; deserves some relaxation, &amp; he wouldn't have thought about it otherwise if he wasn't called out so blatantly about it. The fact that he brought this up the day after it happened proves my confrontation in front of the family worked, &amp; that he did think about it. I just want him to better himself for my mom &amp; their marriage in general (she often complains about his attitude but that's a diff. story) &amp; I honestly don't think he is a good father figure in general, so I'm vocal about it. In the past, he's ignored my confrontations when it comes to my mom, &amp;she isn't the submissive type so she does speak up but she gets tired of dealing with his attitude sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I wrong for calling him out in front of our family like that?",

      "description": "So my wife will be graduating dental school in May and she brought up to me that she would like to practice under our married last name but have her doctoral certificate in her maiden name. Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.",

So a little background I work for quite a large company and am a slightly younger but talented professional, I usually don't get a chance to represent the company but however today I was chosen to over some of the more experienced members of the team. Also recently we as a company have struggled on some projects but most of the employees, myself included believe this is due to our bosses failings, he's quite new to the company and most of the issues seem to stem from poor planning and utilisation of staff.\n\nSo on to today.\n\n I along with 10 colleagues would be competing with a rival who are viewed as one of the best company's in our field, all seemed to be going reasonably well considering some people had written us off from the start but then pretty much the end of the day is where things go wrong. So it had been a long hard day and we were just about at the conclusion and going head to head with our rival company in a decider when I suddenly don't feel great at which point my boss noticing this sends someone over to check on me, they give me a once over I feel ok to carry on and they leave me to it. However it's now my boss decides he doesn't want me to carry on so tries to send me away and replace me with a more experienced member of the team. I outright refuse to leave as I've been working my ass of all day and deserve this opportunity, my boss erupts in a fit of rage but I don't back down and he eventually does. However the kicker is that during my presentation I didn't perform as well as I thought I would ultimately we lost out to our rivals.\n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey, new account just cause I want to use a private one... Anyway, I live with my GF, who is amazing.  We've lived together for several years and we get along great.  We're totally on the same page on a lot of big issues - finances, work/life balance, we do chores together, etc rarely argue.  We work together and compromise so well on so many things. She really is my best friend and I know that I'm hers -- i mean she really is the one.\n\nThere is one thing though we just don't see eye to eye on... This may seem kinda trivial, but she really wants a dog and I really don't.  I never grew up with a dog so maybe I'm really not getting something.. The reasons I don't want a dog are first of all the responsibility, it would need to be taken care of, walked, fed, vet, etc (and as much as she says it will be \"her\" dog, I know it will ultimately be my dog as well and these will become joint responsibilities).  Second, less freedom with travel, third I know it will make the house dirty and while I wouldn't say I'm a neat freak... all my friends with dogs have this kinda 'dog' feel to their house and I don't like it.\n\nI don't see the positives of a dog.  I understand for many people, a dog is a friend that will give you unconditional love.. but I have friends/family and of course her, all of whom I care about much more than I think I could ever care about a dog.  To me a dog kinda seems like having a kid who will forever be a toddler.  (As a side note, we both want a kid maybe 4 or 5 years down the road from now.  I understand having a kid has all the same downsides, but the positive of it is that we'll get to bring a human into this world... if that kid was basically a toddler forever than NO, I would never want a kid... That's a dog to me!)\n\nWe've talked about this many times before, we do communicate really well, she gets where I'm coming from but I know she still really wants a dog.  Like any big decision, she won't get a dog unless I'm on board.  So I kinda am the one standing in the way of her love of dogs.  Am I the asshole for not giving in?\n\ntl;dr GF really wants a dog, I don't. ",

      "description": "Hiya, assholes -- I'm having a conundrum and would appreciate a reality check re: whether I'm in the wrong here. Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nSo: my twin brother [21M], David, has been using Grindr to hook up with guys, for about a year. He's unfortunately had bad experiences -- not anything concerning, more stuff that bruised his pride. This changed six months ago when he told me about his new guy, Greg. Greg, according to David, is great! Greg lives close by and takes David out on real dates! And...Greg is also a 40-year-old. Who is married.\n\nThis, of course, begat a lot of questions, namely: do Greg and his wife have an open relationship? (David said he wasn't sure, which I took to mean \"no, Greg's wife has no idea.\") Are you planning on continuing to see Greg? (Yes, \"although we both know it's not going to last forever.\") And my brother asked me not to tell either of our parents, especially not our dad.\n\nThe thing is, David and Greg's \"I swear this isn't long-term\"...is becoming long-term. I've felt this is not a good idea, bc a) it is shady when a 40-year-old man wants to date a man half his age, and b) I'm morally opposed to cheating. The last conversation I had with David was 2 weeks ago. I asked if he was still seeing Greg and if he had romantic feelings for Greg, and when David replied yes to both, I couldn't take it anymore. I told David that I thought this was a bad idea, that he was hurting someone (Greg's wife), that it was shady, and so on. David insisted that \"age is just a number\" (no, really), and that he and Greg will keep seeing each other. He was also very condescending about how he 100% knew what he was doing.\n\nI got to my dad's house, pissed, and my dad asked why. I told him everything above, partly bc I was pissed and bc I needed advice. My dad took it calmly (basically \"this is a bad choice David is making, but he's an adult\") until I told him that David had once let Greg into dad's house. Dad flipped out. He calls David and tears him one for \"violating the privacy of *my* house w/o telling me\". David apologized and was genuinely remorseful. Next day, David asked me how much I told our dad. I lied and said I only mentioned David had brought a hookup by once. In reality, I had given dad all of the info, including the fact that Greg lives in our dad's development. And recently, dad told me he's learned what house Greg lives in (he saw my brother's car parked in a different spot than normal, and when asked, David made up some weak excuse). Dad has also informed me that he's decided it shouldn't go on; he plans to tape a notice to Greg's door saying  \"Married people shouldn't cheat on their spouses.\" In dad's mind, either Greg's wife will find out or Greg will get paranoid and stop seeing David. \n\nTl;dr: brother is seeing a married man twice his age, told me not to tell our dad, but I did, and now my dad is scheming to get them to stop seeing each other. AITA for lying to my brother, and WIBTA for letting my dad do this?",

      "description": "Throw away since i value my privacy. Forgive the formatting I've had a few to drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last week I went up to see my parents in Alabama. It had been a few months since i'd seen them and wanted to hang out and have some nice home cooked food. during the 6 hour car ride my mom texted me and asked me to pick up my brother along the way. I groaned but obliged seeing as how it'd be the first time the entire family was together in over a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context my brother is a complete shithead. He's been in and out of jail since he turned 19 and refuses to hold down a job for more then a week. My dad pays for his apartment and all he does is smoke weed. I didn't want to deal with him but like I said mom asked me to do it and I can't say no to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked him up and all was well for about 15 minutes till he lit up a cigarette in my truck. I politely explained to him that this was my vehicle and I didn't want him smoking in it. He replied with \"It's just one dude it won't stick\" Once again I told him to put it out (this time not so politely) He basically told me to fuck off saying \"It's freezing cold and raining, I'm not gonna get soaking wet because you can't handle a little smoke\". So at this point I did what I assumed to be completely rational and told him \"If you don't put that cigarette out right now im kicking you out of my truck.\" He declined. So I pulled over to the side of the interstate. Turned off my truck and took the keys with me ( I wasn't about to have him drive off) I went over to his side and ripped him out. He started punching and kicking me but I wasn't having any of this. I threw him out of my truck onto the side of the road and drove off. My parents called me about 5 minutes later screaming about how could I kick my brother out in the pouring rain. I turned around and went home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still don't regret doing it but i'd still like to know if I was in the wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr my brother wouldn't put out his cigarette so I kicked him out of my truck in the rain ",

      "description": "My (lesbian) younger sister is getting married to a girl who is generally very sweet and family oriented, but can be at any given moment alarmingly obstinate. Where the wedding is concerned, my sister doesn't really care about the fine details, she just wants people to have a fun time and of course for her fiancee to be happy. Her fiancee, however, wants everything to be perfect, exactly the way she wants it. \n\nI am in the bridal party, however, I was living abroad when the bridesmaid's dresses (all long and black) were ordered. I picked one and sent my mom my measurements so she could order for me. When she called the shop, they insisted she needed to order several sizes up as the dresses \"run VERY small\". I'm normally a size 4 but the shop convinced my mother to order a 12.\n\nNow I'm back in the country and the wedding is nearly upon us. The 12 was, as expected, WAY too big. I've had it altered several times but it still looks like a sack of potatoes on me. I've now spent over $300 on this thing. \n\nTrying to salvage the situation, I went through my mother and sister's closets and actually found a really classy long black gown my sister wore to her prom - it's a size 2 but it fits me like a glove. My mother sends my sister some pics asking if it would be ok for me to wear this instead of the bride-sanctioned tarp I am currently stuck with. As I said, my sister couldn't care less but she got a very firm \"NO\" from her fiancee; the dress was too different, it wouldn't look right in pictures, etc. Granted, it is a bit different from the official bridesmaid's dresses as the material on this dress is nicer and it's a deeper color black but nothing extreme. I figured being a bit different wouldn't be a huge deal as I am the maid of honor, and it'd certainly be better and far less noticeable than wearing the comically ill-fitting dress.\n\nSo, I've been told no, and my sister, not wanting to cause further drama will not put her foot down on this. The bridal shop will not refund or exchange the dress (apparently everyone signed an \"all sales are final\" form), which means I have to pay full price for a new one as well as expedited shipping to make sure it gets here on time for the wedding, AND I'll have to pay for any quick alterations it most likely needs. My new job doesn't start until just before the wedding, I've just spent thousands of dollars on my overseas move, it won't bankrupt me but this is not the sort of thing I want to be wasting money on especially because I will never wear any of these dresses again.\n\nMy mother did offer to pay for the second dress, but she has already spent far more on this wedding than was initially agreed so I really don't want to be adding to her own financial burden. \n\nWIBTA if just wear the slightly different gown that actually fits me instead of buying yet another dress? \n\nI just really don't want to hurt my sister, particularly not on a day that should be special to her.",

We are done, so we say yes, so the teacher says she'll mark off points for B.\n\nWe walk outside of the building and we find B playing with other friends.

      "description": "A bit of context here, me and my bestfriend are flatmate. Last October wasn't all great for me and I ended paying my rent late and had to borrow him a couple of bucks to eat. It should be noted that I did buy some food, but theres was a lot of times in this period where he saved me for hunger for a stretch. Since then I've been okay financialy and I paid back my friend generosity.\n\nFor the last month he hasn't really live here. He made a GF and went on a month-long coke binge at her place. Spending all his money. Now the food I have here came from my mom to help me concentrate on my studies (I'm doing linear algebra and calc 1 with a serious lack of math fundation). This monday he came back telling me he did not have money because he spent it all on coke. I was okay with that and just asked him to be reasonnable with my food. \n\nIn three days he ate 2 cheese brick, a whole plastic tray of cookie, 12 eggs, 4 bell pepper, almost all of my tofu and a couple other things.\n\nThis is what I ate in two fucking weeks and he and his girlfriend ate it in 3 days, laughing at me(not in a mean way) when he saw my obvious uncomfort seeing all he was eating, promising to buy more food later when he bought a 26oz of good rhum yesterday.\n\nI don't have a problem helping him, not at all. But he know my financial situation and I've asked him to be reasonnable and he still ate that much. \n\nI tried talking to him this morning, telling him that I was not feeling respected since he came back and I know him enough to know that he was pissed, he was generous with me when I had nothing, but I didn't bring some (gril)friends to eat the meagre we had. He's my bestfriend, and I love him. A part of me feel terrible, telling me that he will pay it forward someday and I know he will. But I still need to eat at the end of the week, literally.

My mother, out of all of us, was definitely the most cranky, due to most of us kids forgetting to grab something or do something. When we were loading into the car, I brought my bag full of electronics to put in, now in my opinion, her response wasn’t warranted, but I placed my bag next to my seat in the back row, immediately after, she snatched it and said “I’m going to be stacking other bags there” and I said “Ok, where do you want it”, granted, I was kind of sarcastic, due to the way she was treating us all that morning. That comment made her tip over, so she chucked the bag on top of where I put it at first. Keep in mind the bag had a switch, laptop, DS, and phone inside of it. At that point I snapped as well and yelled “MOM you can’t just throw my computer around like you own it” she whispered “Get in the f**king car, you may not have a chance to play that computer.” Her reasoning was because I yelled outside in our neighborhood.

      "description": "Before people flip out I wasn't making random comments about my girlfriend's sister. I used to be college friends with my girlfriend's older sister. And when my girlfriend and I started dating it was weird everyone was wondering why I didn't end up with her sister. There was no attraction just lots of comments. \n\nAnd my girlfriend always wondered if I had something for her. Btw ages, I am 31 gf is 24, and her sister is 31. My gf was talking about how her sister is having a really hard time dating and what guys go for. I was supportive saying that she is a great person and any guy would be lucky to have her.\n\nAnd she was like be honest is she hot? I wanted to be honest but not make my girl insecure so I said best way I could. I was like she is attractive, she has the whole hot mom/milf vibe going on. \n\nMy gf AGREED! Then later she had a phone call with her sister and she told her what I said. And her sister thought of me as an asshole calling her old. That I was \"too good for her\" wtf? I don't even get this I get she is insecure cause she went through a breakup but lashing out on me? I think its ridiculous",

      "description": "I try my best to be aware of how I’m coming off when chiming in on conversations but I’ve had people tell me it’s annoying sometimes, or that I’ll over explain details at times and it ruins the conversation. I’ve even been accused of “mansplaining” when all I’m trying to do is add information I’ve gained through research to the discussion.  I don’t hear it all the time but I don’t really want to offend anyone. I feel like either I have to sit out and not add to the conversation like a bump on the log or that I might be misunderstood when I do chime in.  \n\nThe most recent example I can think of is when a couple of my friends got together with our girlfriends and we somehow got on the subject of genetics. I got excited because I’m a 4th year bio/chem major that plans on going into a masters or higher in the medical field. I’m not a PhD but I have at least some credible knowledge on the topic. My friend’s girlfriend was talking about something she read online about genes that wasn’t entirely accurate or inaccurate and I filled in the gaps of why it didn’t work the way she understood it too.  It got a little heated because she was vehemently defending this article she read when from what I can tell they weren’t going real in-depth because it was meant for the layperson. She was offended and thought I was just telling her she was wrong and then accused me of mansplaining when really I was just trying to help since she herself said she was a little confused before I chimed in. \n\nI mean I guess I could have just tried to be polite and gave in and said it worked the way she thought it did for the sake of the group but then the group would have been misinformed.\n\nMy girlfriend calls me Wikipedia btw and she thinks it’s cute and actually refers to me for info all the time so maybe I’m just overthinking it.\n\nAITA???\n",

      "description": "Apparently I'm an asshole for this and I do it all the time.\n\nTLDR/BLUF: Today I'm pulled into my manager's office to review some of our feedback surveys and apparently I'm the asshole for giving people the absolute bottom-line up front without some song and dance where I pretend to try to extract the data for 3 or 4 days.\n\nI am a quasi-supervisor for a help desk that supports about 5000 people.  By quasi-supervisor I mean that I'm senior to everyone in the help desk, they report to me for security related stuff because I'm not help desk - I am cyber security, I have about a decade more experience running a help desk than anyone in the help desk, and my management expects me to step in and help out when the help desk workers are scratching their heads over an issue or there is some sort of conflict between our customers and one of our help desk workers.  I guess you could say I'm the unofficial help desk supervisor.\n\nI have customers that come in with actually impossible problems.  A recent flood of requests has been customers coming in with laptops that were imaged for a \"partner\" network to work solely on said partner's network so that our customers (employeed by the same organization I work for) could work on the partner network while they were on said network.  It was the only way to get the partner to allow our hardware onto their network.  Fine.  This partner network is on the other side of the planet from our office.  The image sets up bitlocker to encrypt the hard drive's contents in the event the laptop is stolen.... The data cannot be retrieved by \"slaving\" the drive in another computer.  The partner image completely disables external storage of any type and the use of any disk or floppy drives to extract data - literally the only way to get data off of computers with this image is by connecting it to our partner network and using their network services to get it out of their network.  It's secure because it is supposed to be and designed to be that way for a variety of reasons.\n\nThis level of security is something that many of the IT leaders in my organization and our partner organization and myself have discussed.  We all have also discussed our data back up solution for when people come back to our location and must have their laptops reimaged.. It's all been verified and this is absolutely the only method that is permitted and possible.  So before you go, \"Well, I'm in tech and you could...\" - stop right there because we've already thought about it and it doesn't work.  The partner image will not work on any network but theirs - you cannot plug it in at home or on our network or at starbucks - the image WILL NOT get a network connection.  No use of external storage such as USB, eSATA, CD/DVD, floppy (3.5 in or 5.25 in), zip drives, tape drives, secondary hard drives (our laptops only have one SATA port anyway).  We even thought about somehow virtualizing our customer's laptops and putting them into VMWare - no dice.  Our partner has their shit LOCKED DOWN.  I'm actually kind of jealous.\n\nDue to seemingly excessive security measures in place, we informed our customers that were preparing to come back that they would need to back up their data to our cloud storage in order to retain it and that our help desk has zero capability of restoring data off of this image once they returned to our office location.  We blasted this information out over and over and over again.  When our help desk wasn't blasting the information out, our ENTIRE EXECUTIVE TEAM blasted it out and forced their managers to blast the information out.  Many that had data that they wanted listened.  A small handful did not.  Our help desk was super helpful in assisting those that didn't understand how to use our cloud storage back their data up - a lot of people used said assistance - our feedback surveys showed that they were not only extremely satisfied by the service but they were also extremely satisfied by the professionalism and courteousness of our help desk workers.\n\nA few weeks into people returning to our office (we had about 3,000 employees overseas at our partner site) we start getting people coming to us explaining that they didn't back up their data and they wanted us to back it up for them.  Their laptops are still on the partner image.\n\nAfter the very first instance of this that we had where our help desk worker spent about 30 man hours dedicated in an futile attempt to try absolutely everything to get the data off, I instructed the help desk to send anyone requesting such a service to me so I could explain that we cannot realistically get any data off of their computers short of flying the person with their laptop back to the partner's location and connecting the laptop to their network and having them upload their data to our cloud storage like they should have done while they were on location.  I end up talking to about 20 people about this - many try the \"but there has to be SOMETHING you can do\" and the always loved tactic that I call \"keep going higher in the organization until I find someone that knows how to do it or can force the lazy people at the help desk to to it\".\n\nSo, am I the asshole for skipping all the song and dance when I know the customer has made an absolutely impossible request and instead just telling them the bottom line?",

      "description": "Background: Alyssa and I have been friends for 10 years. We don’t see or talk often but naturally she wanted me to be a party of her special day as a bridesmaid. \n\nDisclaimer: I am also in 2 other weddings between June 1 and July 29. One of which, I am the maid of honor. \n\nI work a very demanding job, my schedule is very rigid/stringent and all my friends are aware of the demands of my job. In my opinion, I do a damn good job at attempting to balance this with my social life. I work every other weekend, holidays are assigned. We are limited to the number of weekends we can take off. \n\nThat being said......\n\nAlyssa asked when a good weekend for a bachelorette party would be. I told her I am free the last weekend of April or the first weekend of May. I had already request off the first two weekends off to go on a vacation prior to any of this bachelorette talk — this is why the last wknd of April or first weekend of May would work for me. Great! We proceeded with the plannings. \n\nLife happens and they had to change the bachelorette party to the third weekend. The reason is bc of the place they rented was avail on the third weekend, not the other weekends. No problem! Issue is, I will be scheduled to work that weekend. I made that very clear. Certainly not upset the weekend had to change but I just wanted to be clear that then it would be out of my hands to make it. I however did thoroughly explain the process of my work schedule, sent photos of the guidelines of how my scheduling works, and did my best to convey that once my schedule came out, I would try to find someone to cover me in whatever capacity I could. It’s not a matter of someone just covering me. It has to do with roles, etc. \n\nThey continued on in planning. No problem. \n\nMy work schedule was released yesterday for the bachelorette weekend. As expected, I’m scheduled to work. Seeing as the bach party is an hour and a half away, I did my best to pull some strings and get Saturday off. A full day of events out of two full day of events. \n\nThis conversation ensues: [1](https://i.imgur.com/LVcNob7.jpg), [2](https://i.imgur.com/ZTnA9r0.jpg), [3](https://i.imgur.com/fA7mnH7.jpg)\n\nI can’t help but feel really heated right now. I almost just want to not even try to swindle the Friday off (it would be a 3 way switch so I’m asking 2 people to accommodate a switch) completely revoke my being available on Saturday and not go at all. My friends are saying they’re surprised I’m even trying to go one full day. \n\nAITA?! ",

      "description": "My mom treats my room like it's hers, which technically it is, but I want some privacy in my room. She barges into my room without ever knocking and cleans my room for me. But I really want her to stop doing that. I want her to knock when she comes into my room and I want to clean my room myself. Whenever she cleans my room, something goes missing and it's not cleaned in the way I would have organized my room. I explained this to her and told her that I will clean my room from now on, and I asked her if she could knock before she comes into my room. She became very angry at me. She said that my room was her house, so she has the right to walk into my room whenever she feels like it and that she doesn't need to knock, and she told me that she's doing a favor for me by cleaning my room.\n\nAlso, she barges into my room multiple times a day for no reason. At least five times a day, she walks into my room, looks around, and walks back out. This really pisses me off because first of all, she doesn't knock and second of all, she walks into my room for absolutely no reason. I'll just be in bed watching Netflix and she walks in, and I look at her to see if she wants anything, then she just walks back out without a word. Maybe I'm being bratty, but it is really annoying when someone barges in and out of your room multiple times everyday.\n\nAnother thing I told her to stop doing is trying to make me hungry. I am trying to lose weight and I'm trying not to eat anything after school. I told her that, but she keeps tempting me with food. When I come back after school, she asks me \"are you hungry\" and I say no. Then she asks \"are you really hungry\" and I say no. Then she keeps asking me if I want to eat food until I eventually give in or I get angry and yell at her to stop. I know this sounds stupid, but it really pisses me off to the point I cry because I'm really trying hard to maintain my diet and she keeps pressuring me to eat even though I clearly told her I am trying to lose weight.",

      "description": "Back story:\n\nMy ex and I are still living together, divorce pending. He works away most of the week and I have the car. We only have one car because of the fact he was always away and it seemed pointless to have two cars. Since we broke up I've picked him up from 15 minutes away or 1 hour away, once or twice a week (UK so this is a long distance for us) and taken him back at sometimes 5am in the morning if he comes home mid-week. This is so that I can have the car.\n\nIssue:\n\nHe is of the opinion I shouldn't make plans on Thursday (valentines) because he needs picking up.\n\nIt is his car (which technically it is) however, and here's the kicker, he wants to buy our house (joint names atm). I can't get a car because his credit will be affected. So, I am unable to get a car until that is sorted. It's valentines and I have a date 50 minutes away, my date hs only just started driving like two weeks ago and doesn't feel comfortable driving that far yet which is understandable. I have to leave before he gets home to avoid evening traffic, so I can't pick him up beforehand (which I have explained to my ex and he just gets annoyed).\n\nMy ex can have his father pick him up (15 minutes away) he's retired but has recently has gallstones and I know my ex doesn't want to bother him but there is also a taxi option. My ex will not use the car Thursday night he'll go home and play Xbox, (he doesn't need/won't use the car).\n\nAdditionally, when he comes home on a weekend so Friday and Saturday this weekend, he will take the car and not consult me on it at all. It leaves me stranded in a city with dire public transportation or taxis(expensive) which I have never bitched about. I get it, it's his car but I made plans and he has alternative options for this one night.\n\nAm I'm just being an a-hole or not?",

      "description": "Last week I got an angry text from my best friend because it was his wife's birthday and I forgot to text her a happy birthday message. She's a close friend of mine and I should've remembered but I think that they blew it out of proportion. My friend said that his wife spent all day in bed crying because no one reached out to her to say happy birthday. She had a falling out with her family which is understandable because they're abusive assholes. And her in-laws aren't that great either. \n\nBut I feel like they think I was single handedly responsible for ruining her birthday. I mean she's 30, not 5 years old. Birthdays shouldn't be this big of a deal to full grown adults, right? I texted her happy birthday after my friend yelled at me but she never replied to me. My friend is giving me the silent treatment. I think this is ridiculous and I don't see why I should apologize. She always remembers my birthday and she sends me gifts but I'm not the type of person to make a big deal out of birthdays... I think she should be mad at HER family and her in-laws, not me. AITA though? I will apologize to her if you find me guilty of being an asshole.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and her friend signed up for an after school activity recently, and realized they needed my help with a large aspect of it. I was told we are all volunteers and I was more than happy to help. However, the workload ended up being divided so I handle half and my girlfriend and her friend handled the other half. This was fine for a while but then my girlfriends friend started hardly showing up and when she did she wouldn’t do anything. I didn’t feel like it was my place to say anything but she just would not do any work and it upset my girlfriend. So I would stay and try to help as much as I could with the work from their half. \n\nAt this point I wasn’t considered a “coach” because I was not listed as such on the paper from the start of the season, but I was acting in full capacity as the coach. So when it came to the competition, we were only allowed to have two coaches, so I had to switch shirts and not participate in judging because my girlfriends friend was acting as the second coach. I did not say anything at the competition but i was upset because I couldn’t participate in the event I had worked hard in as a team member. \n\nThen we find out that the coaches are getting paid, but I am not. Now I originally volunteered for this position, but hearing that her friend is getting paid and I’m not just really upset me, and I know it shouldn’t but it does. I told my girlfriend about everything and she said it isn’t a big deal to not wear the shirt or buttons and I’m overreacting. She offered to split her pay but that’s not the point. I guess my question is AITA for being upset about this whole situation.",

It doesn't seem ridiculous to ask for 2 days of no classes. \n\nThe argument is that we should dress for it, or just not come. But how does one dress for such low temperatures never seen before by this region? And many professors take graded attendence. So missing a class or to \"just 'cause\" could actually affect grades by a letter or so. Unless there are no classes. \n\nI just don't feel that I should be paying thousands of dollars just to have my safety and wellbeing so flippantly disregarded.\n\nSo am I the asshole, here?\n\n",

He got a job in Greece (we live in Sweden) and he was supposed to be there for 6 months. At first I was really upset about not being able to see him for 6 months,but I eventually got over it and I was getting ready for him leaving. We agreed on times we would talk and stuff like that.\n\nBut yesterday I was hanging out with one of his oldest friends and we started talking about Greece and all that. She then told me that he told her that he was probably going to be in Greece for over a year but that he was to afraid to tell me. He’s been knowing all this time that he was going to be there for over a year but told me 6 months so I wouldn’t get so upset.\n\nI went to his apartment and asked him out about it. He told me his plan was to tell me after 6 months that he was going to be there for 6 more months so that I would already be used to him being gone since he knows how upset I was about him going for just 6 months. \n\nWe started fighting. I was crying and told him that I was really upset with him lying to me and that I felt like it was an asshole move of him to just take of and let me think that it was only going to be 6 months but then tell me later that it was going to be for a year. He didn’t understand at all why I was mad and he got super mad at me because he felt like I wasn’t happy for him finally getting a job.\n\nThe thing is,i am happy for him. I’m proud of him. However,i am upset for him lying to me. We are still so young (I’m 16) and I’m not ready for having a distance relationship for a whole year. I was barely okay with 6 months,and now a year? I’m still young. I wanted a simple relationship. I want to be able to explore things. \n\nSo,am I the Asshole for getting mad? Should I be happy for him instead?",

It was really big but not impossible for her to carry. I said no. My reasoning was that it would be a major inconvenience for either of us but I don't see why it should be for me. Don't get me wrong, if it was my friend or someone I would have offered but I don't like when people (women) expect me to do stuff which they could do themselves.\n\nThat being said she was really friendly and cool about me saying no, but I still wonder Am I the Asshole :) \n",

      "description": "Background: Last week my girlfriend needed help with decorating the (school) hall with stuff for the month. I said no because I was really hungry ( she was working during lunch) so I went to eat.\n\nNow, we are working on a science project for school. We need to do research and write 4 pages of info. We have 3 days. 2 for research, 1 for making the poster with all the info and other stuff. I write 1,2 and 4, because she was messing around for the first 2 days, and I tell gf to write page 3. she writes a small amount. The project was due today but we spent all 3 days doing research because i had to do most of it alone. I ask her to help me do the poster during lunch, and she agrees. We go up to our school art room (we go there anyways for lunch everyday with our other friends) to do the project. She instead shows one of our friends the first episode of an anime leaving me to do the poster alone. I end up finishing with 2 min left of lunch. She says a quick sorry and that's it. I want to hand it in now and tell my teacher that I did most of the work and have my gf get a worse grade, But I don't want her to be mad. I know its an A-Hole move to do, but during the research I kept asking and asking, and today while making the poster, she was literal feet from me while I did it alone. I want her to know that that's not fair and she should be punished. Its not even a huge projects but its the principle. I'm not sure what to do.",

I've been really stressed with work and being temporarily a single parent and I haven't been cleaning the house. \n\nShe has a bad habit of leaving clothes on the floor everywhere, in our room, in the closet, on the dining table, etc.  She is progressively detoxing from alcohol so still has a drink at night.  Last night she left her drink at our son's place at the table so it was there when he sat down for breakfast this morning, which really upset me.  \n\nI asked her this morning to please find some time to clean up after herself (I asked politely but it was obvious from my face I was upset). She got really angry that I was \"putting my expectations on her\" while she is in treatment.\n\nSo I'm I the asshole for asking this and should she get a free pass on cleaning her mess while she's in treatment?",

      "description": "I’m currently a 3rd year college student living in an off campus apartment. It’s two bedrooms so in order to save money I share one room with my friend and we let a couple (a guy who also goes to the college and a girl who doesn’t work or go to school) have the other room to split the cost.\n\nThey mostly keep to themselves but one night they come back to the apartment and the guy is holding a puppy. Now we had never talked about    getting a dog before so I really confused with what was happening. I then had to go run an errand, but when I came back I found out that my bike had gotten stolen from the bike rack outside. \n\nAt this point I was heated, so I came back to the apartment to ask some questions. I asked the guy since the girl doesn’t really talk to us, how he thought it was ok to get a dog without asking me or my friend. \n\nHe responded by saying, “we’ll it wouldn’t be your dog so don’t worry about it, we’re just going to keep it in our room.” I also found out that it was a 13 week old Rottweiler puppy, a breed which is not allowed in the terms of our lease, which I pointed out. At this point I’m yelling saying how we never agreed to having a dog at any point and I admittedly should’ve kept my cool a bit more.\n\nThe next morning the guy texts me and my roommate saying that the dog is “going away” while we hash things out, while his girlfriend also went to her grandmas because she was “scared” of me. Eventually me and my roommate find out that the couple had taken out a $2000 loan to get the dog in the first place which is why they couldn’t just return it. When the dust settles, I told them that I refused to keep this dog around on principle and worry for it’s wellbeing being kept in a single apartment room all day and night and that I don’t trust them to take care of it. \n\nLong story short, the dog gets removed from the picture, but the girlfriend says she’s going to kill herself because she didn’t get her “emotional support animal” that she desperately needs because she’s lonely. This was all over the span of Presidents’ Day weekend and at this point I don’t know what to do. I don’t want this girls emotional baggage and mental health to be on me not letting them keep a dog that me and my roommate didn’t ever agree to. ",

We don't have a money limit, but usually I'd say we spend around $50 on each kid. I bought their presents back in November, spending the amount that I usually do and I thought that was that. Then me and my boyfriend of 5 years broke up last week and while I was really depressed I ended up buying more presents for them (spending about $150 on each kid). \n\nI've always loved Christmas, it's my favorite holiday, and I love giving gifts. I love watching them open their gifts all excited and then playing with them so I figured it would make me somewhat happy.\n\nWhen I told my friend about this they suggested that I donate some of the toys to avoid making their parents and my other siblings feel bad. Their reasoning is that they probably don't have as much to spend on them and they would feel bad.\n\nI don't think any of siblings are hurting financially, but I know I'm more well off than them since I don't have any kids and I've got a really well paying job. I was also planning on buying a house in the spring with my ex so I'm sitting on a pile of money there (not that I'm planning on spending it all).\n\nAITA here and should I donate some of the gifts?\n",

      "description": "As the title suggests, I called my friend out for taking the other side of the argument in a petty way.\n\nThere are multiple people involved, so I’m gonna give the first friend the title of ‘B’ and the second friend the title of ‘J’, the rest will be referred to as the group.\n\nI’ve been friends with the group, B, and J since elementary school. There hasn’t been anything that gets in between us too harshly in between the years. Just some simple friend disputes of who gets what and all that, the normal stuff.\n\nThroughout knowing B, he was a loyal friend of mine and the group. He was a friend that could be counted on for situations. Being a middle-man that would look at both sides of the conflict and find the best alternative to those involved. Fast forward to sophomore year of high school. He moved away, which-of course-made all of us pretty sad for the moment. We kept in contact using Discord and host a server for our friends to just chat around in.\n\nAmongst the group, it is seen as a usual friend hangout, just dudes being dudes. There are some rules, but they are very flexible. They are in place due to previous arguments that have happened between some of the members of the group there. \n\nB likes to have these rules seem like they are set in stone rather than sponge.\nEnter in post-moving B, a sudden devil's advocate, who wears the title like a badge of honor. Over the years, B and I have grown apart, not to a horrible extent, we would still talk to each other and catch up, things were normal up until I posted a link to a gofundme for another friend in another group.\n\nThe link got deleted promptly, which made me upset because it was important to me. I check the audit logs to see who deleted it, and it was another friend from the group, not B. I asked him why he deleted it in the server, which started a whole argument between he and I. Later, B got involved. Calling me the A-hole in the situation because I didn’t take it directly to DM’s rather than the server and that I was stupid for doing so an hour after everything was settled between me and the other guy. I figured he was right and decided to just deal with it for the time being. When we elect another mod in the group, or when someone else comes into a power close to his, he gets extremely sad and will often leave the server.\n\nI talked about it with other friends in the group, who I showed the messages from B, and they also mention that he has become rude over the years, the only one he has not been rude to is J. Leaving J as an ally on his end. J and I are good friends as well, until this point.\n\nThere were more things that B has done which I just bottle, but I got tired of it. In the chat, I mention in a petty and passive-aggressive tone that “anyone who assigns themselves the title of ‘devil’s advocate’ is just being a cunt with a title.” While I don’t mention B directly, I mean it towards him. Which, in turn angers J towards me as well because it caused B to leave the server. I’ve apologized to J so far, but I would rather not apologize to B because he causes everyone grief.\n\nI would be the asshole in this situation I think because I tend to hold grudges over pet peeves. Like going against the grain without reason or purpose. \n\nSo I guess, am I the a-hole?\n\nTl;dr    Long-time friend of mine has become rude towards the group, I called him out for being rude and always being on the opposing side in a petty manner, this angers another friend and I worry about the friendship being tarnished because we all suck at letting things go, especially as hot-headed teens.",

      "description": "Just quickly about me: 15 years old, boy, dumb af, have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and she's great. I am 100% confident I won't ever cheat on her.\n\nHowever, I don't know why but if I see a friend that's a girl and she's dressed fancy or something  I'll say things like \"You look beautiful today,\" just to complement her. Now, there's one point you can judge me on, but that's not the main part.\n\nToday, after my taekwondo class, I was waiting outside to get picked up. Friends pass by so I say \"bye,\" and such, and then this girl (I don't even know her name but I interact with her every now and then at the dojo) passes by, I say \"bye\" as usual, and she responds with a \"bye,\" but she goes back to the building after going to her car so I ask \"did you forget something?\" and she said \"No, I'm going to change clothes on the bathroom.\" I just say \"oh, ok\" not thinking much of it. \n\nNow here's the important part. I must say, she is beautiful even in her training clothes. But when she came back out of the building, I saw her and she stunned me how much more beautiful she looked in proper stylish clothes and a \"WOW\" just came out of me and I couldn't contol it. I explained saying \"Sorry, it just surprised me how beautiful you look\" and she awkwardly replied \"Oh, it's fine. Thank you.\" \n\nI felt bad after that... my girlfriend doesn't know and I'm not sure if she should know, but I just feel awful.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I didn't tell my gitlfriend what happened? Or would I be the asshole if I did tell her as she would be really upset? Or maybe I'm just an asshole for saying \"wow, you look beautiful\" to another girl... Maybe I wouldn't be an asshole if I tell my girlfriend honestly? But that will probably do more harm.. Now as I write this I really feel like an asshole \n\nTl;dr - I usually see this one girl in her training clothes but today I saw her in proper stylish clothes and a \"WOW\" came out of my mouth, even though I have a girlfriend who I would never cheat on. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So for starters this post is NOT to start any type of debate or any type of arguments within the chat. I’m simply here because I’ve been emotionally and mentally stressed about this situation for a while now and it is now causing issues for me in my day to day life (ex: migraines, nightmares, stress, insomnia). Keep in mind that I’m a first time poster so this may/may not be in the correct format and it may be very long. \n\nSo some background that is relevant to the story. I’m currently a twenty year old female who’s serving in the US military. Keep in mind this happened when I was seven or eight so it’s been a while back. My family and I lived in Alabama for a while before we moved to Georgia and then back to Alabama again. At this time I stayed with my grandmother a lot since my mother and father were both working and having some martial issues and I would always stay the night with my grandma and grandpa, along with my two aunts, uncle, and brothers and sister. \n\nAt the time of this taking place I was around seven or eight years old and my uncle was around sixteen or seventeen years old. I was over at my grandmas house in the summer and we had a big water slide out back to play with and a kiddie swimming pool. I was there with my uncle, my autistic brother, and two cousins. My uncle was charged with watching us and reapplying our sunscreen because we were little kids and couldn’t reach. While we were playing out in the water, my uncle called us over to reapply. He slathered it on my brother and two cousins quickly but took his time applying it to my legs and arms, and finally my chest. I didn’t think anything of it and scampered off when he was finished. When we were told to come back inside my uncle said I could change in his room. So I went to his room and he watched me change out of my swimsuit and into my underwear before asking me for a hug. I didn’t think anything of it hugged him immediately. He then laid me back on his bed and started touching me all over and blowing on my stomach and chest. (I’m not going any further than that just in case some readers here are sensitive to content such as this and so it won’t cause any bad memories for me). After all of this happened I continued changing and he left the room. \n\nThese interactions continued on for six months undetected after it started and he continued to touch me and make me do things to himself as well. He would always tell me not to tell anyone afterwards and if I did that he wouldn’t love me anymore and that he would hit me very hard. After an interaction occurred I didn’t feel very well and I told my mother what had happened and what I had done with my uncle. She screamed at me and sent me to my room for lying about my uncle and I cried the entire night because I was telling the truth. A few years passed and I was 12 years old. The interactions weren’t as frequent now, but they would always begin if he asked if I wanted to go out somewhere alone with him. My grandmother and I were sitting in the living room and watching television when my uncle came in and asked if I wanted to go swimming. For some reason, and still to this day I don’t know why, I started bawling my eyes out and hyperventilating. My grandmother asked what was wrong and I told her what had happened when I went out with my uncle and what he was doing to me. She was absolutely furious, but not at my uncle, at ME. She screamed and yelled at me to go to a room and told me to stop being such a filthy little liar. She called my mother to come pick me up because she couldn’t handle her “little disgrace” of a granddaughter anymore. I was sent to my room that evening with no supper and a harsh spanking from my mother to “stop telling these lies”. \n\nWe eventually moved away from my grandma and I joined the military. My grandma and I reconciled with each other, my uncle married and divorced and married again and now has four beautiful children who I love dearly. \n\nHowever, no matter how hard I try, I keep thinking about how unfair it is that this scenario turned out this way. Now that I’m older, I want to go back and talk to my mother and grandmother and tell them that it wasn’t a lie and that I was indeed telling the truth. I know this happened when I was little, and I don’t want to ruin my uncle’s career and his family, but I’ve been talking to a therapist and he says that those situations have held me back as an individual and that I need to find closure if I am to ever find peace. I don’t want to come off as a bad person by wrecking a marriage and a man’s career, but I want him and I to take a lie detector test so that the truth can finally be told to my family and so I can finally get some closure, regardless of what the test results may be. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "Before I say anything, I love my mother and am thankful that she at least tried when I was a child. But there are some things  that honestly make me want to get away from her. I'm also sorry for it being so long. I needed to get this off my chest. \n \nBasically severely sheltered me during my entire childhood...and things got worse when she remained. Whenever they'd argue and I'd try to say something, or she'd just ramble on about the fight for however long and I said anything that didn't make me agree with her..she'd go off on me and basically hound me and say that my step dad is brainwashing me. As if i don't have a mind of my own. Will also freak out and think he's leaving and makes me stressed. \n\nSaying every single time that I'm wrong and doesn't even say anything when he comes back. The same thing will happen after every argument. Trying to say every detail and attempt to make me agree with her. But when I just need to talk about something bothering me once in a while she tells me she's too stressed. \n\nShe would simply waste money on too much food, trying to care for my lazy step dad, get him crud and pay bills. There were many times that I was turned away from my doctor&amp; dentist bc we couldn't pay. At one point, in 9th grade, a teacher who helped the special needs kids in the pe class ended up getting me a coat since I had no coat that fit, and we couldn't get one. \n \nI ended up being forced out of college a month in because of an issue. At the time I had some threats of harm towards me, ended up being empty, but she forced me home and it caused financial issues for me. Ended up not being able to get back in for a year and a half. \n\nAfter I learned to drive, she basically turned me into her little personal free cab. I understand helping once and a while, but this was just about every day. Still happens. Whenever she knows I have a free day from work, she wants to do all these things. Making it be like I essentially have no days off. Most of the time when I'm asked if I want to do something, I can't because I'm always with her. Or when I want to go anywhere alone she always wants to go or she spam calls me after an hour. It got worse after some surgery to her knees the last 2 years. She has even gone on about how she will move with me when I move out. Guilt tripping me and using my pets as an excuse to have me stay. \n\nI could say a lot more, but it would end up too long. But it honest to God feels like she's stuck to my side. After nearly 22 years of being alive..I feel like I'm going to be stuck like this. I love my mom and I'm sorry she saw dad die when I was young.  I don't know if it's because I'm the youngest. I can't keep going through her freak outs or her mental state in general.I feel like she's trying to live through me. Like she wants to keep me with her for her life. If I even try to talk to her about this, it will just end up in an argument, unfortunately. ",

The first year and a half was great because we saw each other 2 or 3 times a week for a decent chunk of the day and got along real well, but in the last year roughly things have changed, her parents started up a hobby farm to which they’re going to retire to and is two hours+ drive from where her and I live. she has to spend a lot of time there because of the work that needs to be done with the animals. This has meant that the last few months i have only seen her once a week and on occasion once every two weeks. I work and study so my weeks have things on, as well as my sport on the weekends and she also has a part time job and study’s, hence why we only see each other once a week. Am I the asshole for not wanting to date someone I barely even see and barely talk to, I’m 21 and don’t see why I should be so committed to one person at this age, not to mention as a result of not seeing her much the interactions are awkward ",

I already dislike my GIL as she keeps trying to hit my dog, and wants to confine him in the bedroom. I used to get along with his family but they've been very on edge to me and I can't imagine how they'll treat me as I'm a Crunchy Mom (google it). My mother is very supportive of everything I do, which is why she stuck up for me, but she understands I don't want any more animals as I'm having a baby lmao... I just feel like his family doesn't even care to get to know me.",

      "description": "TLDR: Am I the asshole for keeping track of the original topic of a conversation, and bringing it back even when the conversation might have drifted to other topics?\n\nThis happened around Christmas and I've been thinking about it ever since. \n\nIn my mind, even if the topic of a conversation drifts, most of the times I keep track of the original topic and if there was something I still want to say it about it, I try to bring the original topic back so I can finish that conversation. \n\nNow, my mom is kind of the opposite. She has a couple topics, mostly related to her work or projects, and most conversations with her end up drifting towards that, then away from it and back to it, several times. \n\nWe had a disagreement on Christmas because of it. We were talking about a sweater that she's knittinng for me (got ruined in a dryier machine and she undid it and is doing it again), and I was telling her a story about the sweater and how it had got ruined, and somehow she made the topic drift to my biology teacher in middle school, then to a biology teacher she's working with, and from that to the project she's doing with the teacher. \n\nThen when I told her that whenever I talk with her I feel that the conversation always turns into the things she's doing and interest her, regardless of what I have been saying, she argued that that is the way conversation works, going from a topic to another, and that I hold on too much to the original topic of a conversation and try to bring it back even when it stopped being relevant to the conversation. \n\nThen she let me finish telling her the story about the sweater, but it felt like she was only doing it because I was forcing her to and she really didn't want to hear about it. \n\nSo... what do you think, reddit? Have you met people who do this kind of thing? Are they (like I would be) assholes?\n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for keeping track of the original topic of a conversation, and bringing it back even when the conversation might have drifted to other topics?",

I congratulated him too that he's found a girl he really likes.\n\nThen they turned to me and asked whether I love my girlfriend. I said that I do, but I don't know why I said this, as I was drunk, I just blurted out ''I love her very much, I really do, but...there's noone in the whole world that I love more than myself.

It's socially acceptable for a guy to say he loves his girlfriend/wife more than anyone, or it's socially acceptable for a mother to say she loves her son more than anyone (or a father loves his daughter more than anyone).

      "description": "Bear with me but just give me a second to explain. \n\n\nThis goes back to end of October in 2018. I had met my ex-crush (lets call her person A). I had taken her under my care, explaining uni things and updating uni stuff. basically handing her a golden ticket to a first (70% and up) degree. The infatuation with A grew when she let me into her life. Fast-forward to a month ago. I had just come off a holiday to Dubai. Then my family went, hence I was alone and would try to spend as much time as with her, failed hardcore. Impossible. (Just a little tl;dr for context)\n\nNow, It is the 4th week into university and she has not come in for, now coming into, 5 weeks. I still have feelings for her (my heart rate increases every time her name gets mentioned) but I have tried to put this aside. Although, I am done trying to ask her out or try to make her my GF. \n\nThere is a group work that we have to do for uni. And she hasn’t been in for all of it. The other people (persons B and C), they are willing to do the work where as they had chosen me to be their team leader. I had received a call from her (after ghosting me for 5 straight days) asking about uni stuff. I said I will explain to you physically as it’s too much to text and call over. She came in once for a total of 2:30 seconds. She had to leave because of “medical problem” (quote marks explained later). Now, B and C are telling me to kick her out because she is dragging the group down. I kept saying give her a chance, she might come round but as of this week, she said she would “come in 100%, defo Thursday, will defo come in afternoon” (actual quotes) all BS. Now I have a deadline and I have no Idea what to do. If I kick her out, a shitstorm will fly to me like  a hurricane. Same goes with staying in. \n\nAlso, I say medical problems because she seems to have a lot. Her knee is fucked, her mouth is fucked, her health has gone down the drain even though she is the most athletically fit person in the world. Which I have no Idea. To add to that, she was off antibiotics and was “gagging and coughing” whilst being in a 5 star Scandinavian restaurant in central London 2 days ago when she was supposed to be “ill”.  Right now, I have no idea if this is true or if she is lying to me. \n\nWIBTA if I kicked my ex-crush out of group work in uni?\n\ntl:dr ex-crush who I still have feelings for is not doing the work in uni, other people are telling me to kick her out, I keep protecting her",

      "description": "This happened a couple of years ago. I was in a relationship with this girl who I felt I was in love with. The first couple of months were amazing with her, and we seemed to fit perfectly with each other. But then, things began to get tiring. Whenever I wanted to talk to her about anything, she would steer the conversation to how shitty the situation at her home is. I would stop talking about myself and listen to her and support her. \n\nThere were a few months where I felt down because it felt like I wasn't able to make friends. She would always be by my side and glare at anyone who approached me. I noticed this and called her out on it but she said she did it unconsciously and apologized. And I let it go. \n\nEvery time we fought, she would cry and tell me that I'm acting like her mother or her other family members. She said she couldn't handle it. I tried to approach her once about how it felt like she was ignoring me when I wanted to talk about myself for a change. I remember that night really vividly. She sobbed and wouldn't stop, telling me I was scaring her because I confronted her like her mother usually does. And I began comforting her and apologizing. Now I remember *I* apologized every time I felt something was wrong.\n\nShe's always been known as a sensitive person, but I couldn't handle it anymore. I was weak as well. Over months, I had stopped confronting her and standing up for myself. I was *scared* of confronting her. I was scared to tell her I wanted to break up.\n\nSo I told her that I had to breakup with her because my family found out (I'm from a place where dating is a huge no-no). \n\nShe began yelling at me, and then after an hour she apologized, and then began yelling at me some more. It became a huge issue when she revealed that we were dating without my consent to her family even after me explicitly telling her not to. \n\nIt took me months of counselling to realize that she was emotionally abusive. She was controlling. I'm very glad I broke up with her.\n\nBut, AITA for using a lie to do it? ",

The conversation continues through different topics until F1 brings up Fortinite(yes yes I know not the best) to which F2 responds\" no Fortnite so f*cking gay man\" so on and so forth, both agreeing with each other and basically applauding each other's hateful views,meanwhile I'm in the middle of them feeling absolutely livid, however it was what they said next that broke the camel's back, F2 says \" I would disown my child if they were gay!\" And F1 agrees enthusiastically, instantly I scream out \"WTF?!?!\" followed by a slur of insults and swears directed at my two friends, that comment just made me too angry to not speak out about it, and frankly made me sick. After the whole ordeal I left them and went home myself, I saw them talking in the halls at school and we've just kinda brushed past each other \n\nTLDR : friends homophobic comments made me WAY too angry and I snapped evantually, and I'm not really sure if I wanna forgive them\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "right so, I’m 17 (girl) and live with my family, the one in the house who clears plates and loads the dishwasher every day, family stuff you get it. But my step dad had a bowl of cereal this morning, didn’t like and so just left it in the sink, still full of cereal and milk. So I’m loading the dishwasher tonight and find it, all crusty and shit so I’m like right who done this? I get I load the dishwasher but you can at least get rid of the food before you leave in the sink to fester, cause now I have to scrape it for like 10 mins to get all the oats and shit off. So I find out it was my step dad (after him trying to pin on my brother) and I say, well can you tip it in the bin next time. That was it, wasn’t even having a go just said it nicely. \n\nSo, he LASHES out at me with “WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY? I get up and go to work every morning you think I have time for that shit? “HOW FUCKING DARE YOU, I get up for work while your laying in bed” (I’m not, I’m just on study leave for school this week and stay in my room to study). \n\nAnyway it all escalated to me getting shouted at that I’m a lazy piece of shit, don’t pay my way in the house so I need to move out because I’m old enough now (im 17 and still in school- do I look like I can afford to move out), and for the next 10 mins he’s in the living room ranting to my mum “I can’t fucking believe she just said that, I’m shocked, the sooner she leaves for uni the better”. \n\nNone of this is exaggerated btw, this is actually the way my step dad is, and I’m trying to get an honest opinion\n\nI’m honestly so baffled, like is my step dad the asshole I think he is or am I asking too much for him to put his cereal in the bin? Like the amount he was shouting over this was unreal, I’m not getting it, someone help\n\nTLDR I ask my step dad to put his unwanted cereal in the bin instead to leaving it crust up so I don’t have to scrape it off when I load the dishwasher, he shouts bloody murder at me because hes the breadwinner and I’m 17 and don’t “pay my way” in the house, just do chores.",

      "description": "Okay, so I'm in a university program that is largely project based. There are no tests, but throughout the semester the 'finals' for all but 1 of the classes has been a group project of some form or another. We have had to write an academic report, make a filmed interview, a visual/video essay and the main project for the course, a magazine. \n\n For the magazine project, I took on a huge role. I wrote 4 of the 12 articles, edited all of the other 8, worked really closely with the art director and made sure that it all got done in time. I'm not saying that the other people in the group didn't work hard on it as well because they did. I just took on the largest role and spent the most time on the project. \n\nNow, I should note is that this is a really international program. I am the only native English speaker- not only in the project group, but the class. It is an English program, everyone else speaks English but for most, it is a second or third language.  This is mostly why I was given the job of editor but I also really enjoyed the role. I made sure I didn't phone it in and invested a lot of time and effort into the project.\n\nThe problem came when we started working on the video project for another class. I was with a girl who was also in the magazine group with me. We'll call her A. A was probably the person who struggled the most with English. Throughout the semester she was constantly asking me to look at her work. I didn't mind because she was really nice about it and she would always say thank you. She was never rude if I couldn't get around to it right away and she understood that going through her work was my last priority when I was doing other things.\n\n A is really good at video editing and production. That is definitely not my strong suit so instead, I ran the interview portion with our subjects, and mapped out a script. It definitely did not take nearly as much time or work as A put into the video editing and I knew that. I thought it would even out because we got a really good grade on our magazine. That grade was the same for everyone in our group, which of course included A. \n\nApparently, A did not feel the same way. She sent me a really long text telling me how hurt she was that I didn't help her more with the video. She said she didn't want to work with me in the next term and that she would be letting our Visual communications prof know about how little work I had done. \n\nTo make matters worse, we have a 'peer review' sheet where we have to give each other a grade for the work we did. It's a grade out of 5. We're supposed to rate each other and we see the grade that the other person gives. It's weird that it's not anonymous but I guess it is a good evaluation tool. She gave me a 1 in every category- including the interview. Which, I know I didn't do a lot but I feel like I should get credit for the part that I did do. I felt so bad that I gave her 4's and 5's in every category to try and make up for it and because she really did do a good job on the video.  I'm pretty upset and I don't want to have to retake the class because of this. Am I in the wrong here? Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My friend’s wedding is coming up in July, and I’m a bridesmaid. The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I’m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She’s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I’m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90’s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I’ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I’m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can’t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn’t fit in with her ‘vision’), and I’m worried I’ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I’ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I’m made to feel like I’m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn’t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe’ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don’t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. ",

      "description": "Background Information: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was friends with this person (we'll refer to her as Hermia) since sixth-grade. Hermia does this thing where once she enters a relationship, she quickly forgets her friendships and her focus turns completely onto her partner. I previously struggled hanging out with her because her partner 'hated sharing her'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September, my sister finally had enough and decided to leave her abusive husband. Unfortunately, he began to stalk our family. Everyone was on edge and the smallest things would set us off. Discussing my brother-in-law was difficult because one parent believed it was meant to be kept private and I believed he somehow had connections to people I knew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermia was really the only person I was comfortable sharing updates on the situation with aside from writer/online friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermia interrupts my venting/updates to say: I went on a date last night and it was probably the best date of my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer concern? Her boyfriends name was the same as an ex-girlfriend of mine who we hate and would I be angry? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was extremely hurt and began to distance myself from her. I received the occasional text which would just be her sending a meme or holiday related text. I didn't expect she would remember my birthday but she did and apologized for not being there as much as she could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, admittedly, snapped and shared how hurt her comments made me. Again, everything was about her boyfriend and his friends. We no longer had a friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited a week and received no response. We are no longer speaking and she has me blocked on every single form of social media. ",

And I was told if he is released then I have to bring him to my spot because he can’t go back home. He has no job so I won’t be paid back, and I got his kids for who knows how long. I’ve had his whole family stay with me before and it was a mess. Now even if I bail him out, which I won’t. I then have to provide a place to stay because he can’t go home, hotel or my house.

So after some realization of what food is left over at the end of the week, i realize we don't eat our whole bag of potatoes each week. \n\nSo i was talking to my husband and said we should hand out potatoes to people on street corners when we pass by.  He thinks it would be really rude, bc they are expecting cash, and giving potatoes would be really weird. I think he thinks it would make them mad.

I got all the grades, I'm going to college while also having a good job. I've done everything (most things) right.\n\nHe on the other hand has been an ass. He bullied me when we were kids. He was at constant odds with my parents especially my dad. I spent most my life hating him but he has chilled out a lot, with me at least, so I'd say we are more friends now. But he's still awful to my parents.\n\nYesterday he walked in crying about how he wants to be a Firefighter but mom and dad dont believe in him (after he put a hole in the wall because he was mad). To do this he has to quit his job with my dad's friend after promising he wouldn't, so my dad is unhappy about that. \n\nI told him explain himself to them, why he wants to do it, his plan to go about it, they aren't unreasonable and will help him do whatever he wants. That's when he said he wants to be a Firefighter because they are cool.\n\nI was done, I laid into how that is beyond a dumb reason to chase a career, how he's done no research at all and no wonder they are pissed. I told him he's a dick to them and needs to act like an adult and prove they should believe in him cause he's done a piss poor job of doing it so far. He just kind of walked away.\n\nI love my brother, my parents love my brother but god he's hard to deal with sometimes. Am I the asshole? I was trying to help him but maybe I could have gone about it in a more nice way... lifes been hard on my whole family lately and we are all pretty on edge. Let me know what you think.

I have a small interest and bought things from there a couple of times in the past. \n\nThe guy who runs the shop has been regularly coming into my shop for food. He either sits in to eat or asks for takeaway to be delivered to his shop. He's always been chatty to me and being a server there's some element of obligation to converse with customers. So I chat back.\n\nHe's been coming in on pretty much all of my shifts. We take it in turns to work at the ordering counter or be delivering food. Somehow when it's busy I'm always delivering food to his shop when it's quiet I'm always at the counter and he sits inside to eat and chat to me.\n\nI saw him watching my Instagram stories before he even knew my name. He then asked a co-worker what my name was (weird spelling) and he does not know anyone else's name. He has even brought me a present - an expansion pack for something I bought at his shop. I feel a bit awkward around him. He has asked me my shift times, who I live with etc. But all my co-workers say he's just being nice because we share a common interest. I'm starting to dread him coming into work now and seeing him.\n\nHe walked past me in the street today and I pretended not to notice him. A guy I was with said that was a harsh of me as he's just a nice guy and we work in close proximity and I was being a dick.\n\nGuy number 2:\nMaintains the Victorian arcade. He's always wandering around in and out the shops. He comes into our kitchen a lot and chats to us. He is always really friendly with guys who are more...established within the community and big business owners and all the women. My co-worker has an excellent butt and I always catch him staring. Sometimes I've turned around and see him staring at my butt then quickly glance up. \n\nHe walked past me in the street and smiled and winked and waved. He went to stop to chat and I just did a tight smile and walked on. He has since told other people in the place we work that I'm a rude bitch.\n\nGuy number 3:\nRegular customer in my shop. He's nice enough. Always makes small talk while he waits for his food but doesn't linger. I passed him in the street and he came up to me to chat. After 2 minutes I made up an appointment I had to leave for so I could go. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I single mom of four children. I live with my youngest (22M) son and eldest (28F) daughter but my youngest daughter visits home on weekends from school. \n\nMy eldest daughter is (28F) and she has been talking to a (30M) overseas and they've caught quite the fancy for each other. My daughter has never been one to really take on responsibility, for example she works 1-2 shifts a week, has argued about continuing school or going full-time, etc... Yet she met this guy over PlayStation Network and she wants to have him down for three weeks. She only recently met him and then he paid for her to come to England to meet him officially where she stayed for 3  weeks. This was something that I was not comfortable with either but due to her age and autonomy, I gave in and let her go. I had plenty of family telling me that her decisions are her own now and I can't have much control over that. That's fine with me as I understand her age and just want whats best for her.\n\nI let my other children have their significant others over commonly over the weekends, this time I'm a bit hesitant due to my lack of knowledge of the guy and just being a older female alone in my house with him while she is at work or anything else. \n\nI feel as if I may be biased just because my other children met their significant others through school or from events/places around the area. So I've been trying to tell her that she needs to find him a place to stay for the time being as everyone in the house feels as if a stranger from overseas would be uncomfortable, mind you at I feel she is rushing things and this is one of her irresponsible phases (This isn't the first guy shes met online, but the first shes engaged and it all just seems so fast for her to actually make a decision, when I know she doesn't always think things through.) \n\nShe claims that she wouldn't be around and always with him and it would have no affect on the family household but she does work those 1 or 2 shifts a week that would leave him here along with the other kids in the house having their daily lives to attend to. There is not much in our area to do or see, so we know that they would be here frequently, as is every other couple in the household.  For now, I've said no and she's said if it were any other kid I'd allow it but my main issue comes from it being a stranger from across seas with no connections or ties here or anything. Someone maybe just wanting a fun trip.\n\nTL;DR My Daughter met a guy over PlayStation, She went to England to meet him for 2 weeks and announced that she's engaged after she returned. Now she wants him to come over and stay with us for 3 weeks or possibly a whole month. I'm a single mom with other children at the house so its something I'm not fully comfortable with and feel as if shes rushing, so have said no but she believes its just favoritism to my other children.

      "description": "I’ve been planning a small/medium sized gathering at work and it will be done at an all day camp sort of thing in the desert. It’s only my first month at this job and I’m an HR coordinator, but my manager gave me permission to host this gathering under the company’s name to prove myself. It’s a family event and most of my coworkers are a lot older than me and married. Most of them will be bringing their wives and kids. \n\nMy boyfriend of one year isn’t very social and he likes to stick to what he already knows. He has a few close friends but that’s it. However I’m on the other side of the spectrum and I like to meet new people and get to know them. This is probably why I don’t fully understand his point of view. \n\nI told him about the event and that it will be done on Friday, he knows I’ve been working on it for two weeks now. I told him about it more than once and he kept saying “we’ll see”. So I left it at that. \n\nToday while we were talking on the phone he mentioned to me that he’s going out with his friends to the desert on Friday. This of course caught me off guard and I asked “so you aren’t coming to the event?”. And he said he wasn’t going to and he’d like to go hiking with his friends. \n\nI know he has the right to do whatever he wants with his free time, and I would be an asshole if I forced him to come. I won’t talk to him about being upset he isn’t coming, because it’ll sound like I’m trying to guilt him into coming. My question is, am I the asshole for feeling upset/disappointed in the first place?\n\nThanks in advance! Sorry for the long post and if my English isn’t good, it’s not my first language. ",

      "description": "For context the event described happened around 1,5 years ago but the effects of it are currently still being felt.\n\nDuring that time our highschool clique had entered their 2 semester of university and with that came the end of my friends relationship with his highschool sweetheart who was also part of our group. This relationship had been going on for around 4 years and seemingly ended out of the blue. The reality of it was that his now Ex wanted to explore her youthful freedom which she could not do with him as he was a bit more uptight about things.\n\nWhat then followed where around 2 months of unrelenting whining, self-pity, more whining and toxic behaviour towards the people who were trying to comfort him. I was one of those people and unfortunately at one point I snapped.\n\nI had been drinking that evening with him and another friend of mine, because what else are you going to do when you are a student, and he had been pretty whiny and very much insulting towards me that evening again. This was so far tolerated by us as, because he has a reputation for being oh so emotionally sensitive and a 4 year relationship ending is pretty hard on anyone. As we were on our way home he started talking shit about his ex, while also wishing she would come back to him and then insulting me again for me stating that what he was saying was not okay, as I am also good friends with his ex. This is where I told the statement in the title of this post, as it had been a pretty shitty week so far and I went drinking with them to get a way from negative emotions and not have them forced onto me.\n\nHe then subsequently started screaming at me, how I could ever say something like that to him, then insulting me again followed by him crying and running away from me and my buddy. We just let him go and went home by ourselves. I even asked my friend if he thought that was too harsh, but he just said that he would calm down eventually.\n\nSince this event, he has gotten another girlfriend (who is going to leave him in the summer as she is going to the USA), and every time we meet some sort of new acquaintance (especially if it is a woman) he acts very disrespectful and toxic to me, seemingly to degrade me in front of others. Based on me not having had a girlfriend yet, he tries to do this to make me feel insecure. This also happens less frequently within our usual friend circle as he probably does not want them to call him out on it. While this does not phase me very much emotionally it usually does kill mine and the groups vibe. He explains this by stating he has aggression problems (No reason to be a cunt), and because of the things I have said to him in the past. The event described above is the only recollection I have of me being rude towards him. \n\nSo am I the asshole for apparently starting a timeless conflict I have no interest participating in?",

      "description": "I am an Asian American female in her mid-twenties who works at a large tech company.  Most of my relatives are overseas, and both my parents are well-educated and came to the States with little money and we scrimped and saved to get where we are.  This means I never really had Christmas or birthday presents growing up.  We are in a much better place today, and I have an O.K. relationship with them currently despite a lot of problems in the past.\n\nWe have relatives back home who think we are wealthy and always have thought thus just because we live in America.  The more our financial situation improved, the more they ask.  I speak to my grandparents once ever three months for less than a minute each time.  My extended family, I barely ever talk to.   \n\nThe only time I really hear from them is when they ask my parents to buy them luxury goods to ship back (no, they don't pay).  Three years ago, my grandma begged my mom to ship back an iPhone for my cousin.  \n\nMy cousin's mom consistently cares about luxury products and makes my 80 yo grandma cook dinner and box it in a to-go box so she can save money while doing night shifts as a nurse.  Anytime I bring this up with my mom I get scolded for being mean to my aunt and Cathay my grandma does it willingly.  Never mind that she has high blood pressure, heart disease and really should be resting.  My aunt always wants a vegetable dish, a healthy meat dish, along with fucking rice.  \n\nRecently, my cousin came to the US to study at a school who recruits Chinese students for their ability to pay full tuition.  She is taking undergraduate/language courses even though she is enrolled in an university.  The only time they have really talked to me is to ask me for university information.  I laid out the steps to send in an applicantion, but they didn't do it and got a company to fill out her whole application and write all the essays.  \n\nThey want my parents to help them find someone for their daughter to marry so she can get US Citizenship and call every other day now to my parents asking for information/advice/to do crap for them.  Recently they have started asking me too.  My cousin texts me every once in awhile to show her life in America, but I don't really want to do anything.  She goes to school in a predominately white university, and only hangs with other Chinese international students that make up 99% of her masters program.  Recently my mom asked me to set her up with someone from my tech company as there are many single Asian American males with citizenship.  \n\nI feel really fucking disgusted and we had a huge argument.  I basically told her they were her family and not mine and should stop asking for handouts.  She has told me to repeatedly pity my cousin because she's poor and that she can't stay in the states.  Her family is middle class by far, and she doesn't want to try to obtain an H1B working visa as it is too hard and competitive.  \n\nThey have yet to ask me to buy them things or for money.  I have stopped myself from getting close to my cousin because I'm afraid they will ask me for favors and ask for money as they know I am well off at my age.  All this has caused my mom to turn on me by calling me heartless and greedy, and that I don't care about family.  Her family has never reached out to me.  ",

      "description": "Context, my ex-bf and I go to the same university. We dated for about 3-4 months, he accelerated the relationship so much and I was mostly ready for it. He was the one who verified that we were official, said the L word first (after I told him it was too early). Everything else was pretty good. We just returned from winter break and that time period of distance (8 hours apart for a month) really screwed things up. He barely reached out to me or showed interest, it felt like he was completing a task to talk to me. We argued a bit about it and he stood his ground, and I ended up compromising. This left me a bit resentful and sad and for the last week of break I figured a breakup was on the horizon. I was losing sleep, some nights I couldn't even fall asleep for an hour. I knew AT LEAST a conversation would have to take place.\n\nThere's some context as to the state of the relationship when we return to school.\n\nSo when I get back, he stops by for 2 hours which were not spent alone. We hung out with my suitemates, no 1 on 1 time. He was leaving to go watch a show (he watches weekly), and I asked what he was doing after. He tells me he \"got 3 hours of sleep and is probably just going to go to bed after.\" I was disappointed, but there wasn't much I could do. \n\nShortly after he leaves, I decided to text him to tell him that he \"should sleep over, my roommate wouldn't be here.\" When he replies, he informs me that he's actually drinking with his suite tonight and he will \"come after if he wants.\" At this point, I am sure the relationship is over. I didn't want to have to end it but I can not be treated that way. This was consuming my mind, my sleep, my eating, everything. I text him that I need to talk to him tonight, he says he's busy and already took 3 shots. I say it's important and he says \"if I was doing nothing I would.\" He protests, and I eventually give up, trying to work on school work.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of trying to get work done, my mind can not focus on anything else. I needed the result. I apologize and tell him that it is an absolute need for him to come over. I literally said \"If you have any respect for me not even as your boyfriend, but as a friend, you will show up tonight because it is that important to me.\" Mind you, we live in adjacent buildings (30 second walk, no joke). He protests still, at this point I am infuriated and I have to end it, I can not put it off another day. I even told him that I got zero hours of sleep the previous night because I needed to talk to him about this and he essentially shrugs it off. \n\nI decided that there was no other choice and I just ended it there over text. I simply said I am breaking up with you, and that was basically it. He asked if we can be friends, but after that conversation I told him that he showed his lack of respect and therefore I have no interest in being friends. \n\nTLDR; bf gave me crumbs of attention, wanted to talk about it and potentially break up with him. He refused to walk 30 seconds to meet up with me when I told him I needed to talk and that it was important (stated that I was losing sleep over this). His excuse was that he had started drinking (3 shots) and was busy.\n\nAITA for \na.) breaking up with him over text?\nb.) telling him I have no interest in being friends due to **this conversation** alone?",

      "description": "My friend (we'll call him Jeff) recently celebrated his 20th birthday and I drove 250 miles to see him. Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?",

She eventually told me though, and I made her swear on our friendship to use them.\n\n-These days, she has gotten more and more depressed, and I notice it gets worse whenever she comes from hanging out with him.\n\n-His friends are known around school to be general dickheads, and after spending time with them once, I see why. For example, they repeatedly ask to call me \"their nigga\" (I'm a mixed kid, they are very white), and while there was a ballet performance at our school, one of them repeatedly kept talking to the girl when she came offstage, even after she told him she wasn't interested, because he thought she was cute.\n\n-Going back to a previous point, whenever she does feel sad, she will truthfully tell him she doesn't know why, but he will think she's hiding something from him so he will *punish* her by acting moody and making her feel like shit\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m (20F) moving out soonish, and my sister (12F) has asked me to take her cat with me because she doesn’t think she can handle him by herself. Which leads me to wonder, why adopt him in the first place?\n\nI told my parents, a million times over, that no, she can’t handle a cat, she’s not going to take care of it. But she fed my cat for *three days*, and my dad caved. It’ll teach her responsibility, he says, and he and I have spent the entirety of the last year taking out her cat’s litter box because, “it’s gross.”\n\nI’ll admit that I could take care of her cat. I do! I already feed him, I play with him, I take him to all his appointments, I brush his teeth weekly and feed him his medicine and give him baths when he rolls around in mud. Hell, I pay for his vet insurance. (Admittedly, our parents funnel a good deal to me monthly, but it is technically my money.) I could afford him, I’d have time to take care of him, the apartment my boyfriend and I are looking at has plenty of room.\n\nBut I don’t want to take him. My own cat is reaching ten, and I don’t think I could emotionally handle another pet when he dies. But if I leave him here, the responsibility will most likely fall to my dad, who is reaching 60 and has health problems. \n\nWould it be totally awful if I did take him with me only to adopt him out? I’d make sure he finds a good home. My sister would be crushed, but I feel like it’s the best option. ",

      "description": "My wife [F25] and I [M23] were out with some of her friends yesterday for some wine tasting. I am naturally introverted and talk less than she and her other extroverted friends do. She usually invites me along because she knows I like to do events like that and I do still try to participate in the extroverts conversation.\nThe issue was when we were in a line of 4 people at the bar. Here is the setup. My wife was second to last on the right and I was to her right with no one else on my right. Her friends were on her left. While we were at the bar, she was fully facing toward her friends so all I had facing me was my wife's back. Not once did she try and turn to include me in the conversation.\nI know I don't talk as much as her and her friends but I still like to participate and listen. I usually have some things to say. I eventually asked her once if she wouldn't mind stepping back a little so that I may also join in the conversation but she quickly turned back to just her friends. I could have moved to the left to make myself more central to the group but I felt like that would've been awkward. I didn't want to be the center of attention, I just wanted some space on the end to feel included.\nOnce we arrived home, she told me how its pointless to include me because it's not like I contribute to the conversation at all. Even when I tried to talk, she kept facing her friends. Am I the asshole for suggesting she position her body in such a way that allows for 4 people in a line to talk to one another?",

      "description": "Background: I’m 22 and just purchased my first car 2 months ago. Younger sister and brother are 17 and 16, respectively. \n\nThis morning we were pretty much empty on groceries. The only thing we really had were cereal and milk, which I was fine with for breakfast. My siblings are a little pickier, and one of them got the idea to get Starbucks and asked to use my car. \n\nIf it were last week, I would have been ok with it. I’ve been letting them use it for necessary things if it’s available (going to work, school, etc). Are schedules are kinda busy so if the car is just sitting there I usually let them use it if they ask. But a few days ago, when I had let them use it to go down the street to 7/11 for a couple snacks, they took it even further to the McDonalds (about 10 minutes further). I had specifically told them *not* to do that, as I don’t like them taking it too far if it’s not necessary (like I said, for school and work). Since 7/11 is pretty close I let them.  When they got back, I was very upset and told them they were no longer allowed to drive my car unless it was unnecessary. I’m kinda overprotective of my possessions, but they’ve shown to be kinda reckless with things that aren’t theirs. \n\nSo when they asked to take it to Starbucks today, I flat out refused and reminded them of this incident. They started arguing that there was nothing to eat (they’d be fine with eating cereal on most days, but once Starbucks popped into one of their heads, there was no turning back). \n\nThey kept begging me, and I didn’t really feel like going out until later (I had some errands to do), so I offered to order a pizza to tide them over (it was 12 o’clock so right around lunch at this point). My brother seemed ok with that, but my sister continued to beg for Starbucks. \n\nSo I reluctantly tell them “fine, I’ll take you, but I have some errands to run. We’ll get Starbucks on the way home.” They both refused the offer this time. The argument was probably more heated than I am making it sound, but that’s basically what happen. I yelled at them “fine, then don’t get anything” and walked out. \n\nI just got a call from my mom; they must’ve “told” on me to her. My mom has a habit of taking the side of whoever complains to her first. I tried explaining my side to her, but she insisted I was wrong; “they’re hungry; what’s the big deal?”\n\nSo AITA in this situation? ",

I myself didn't think the test was very important, so I didn't tell anyone, except the friends that encouraged me to try it in the first place. That number is around 5. In total around 8 people knew about the results, none of which is my family since I didn't think it was very important to tell any of them. \n\nFast forward to March 2019, during a casual conversation with my family I told them that I did the test and showed them the results. My mother was very happy for me at first, and pleasantly surprised that I did the test. When I mentioned that about 5 of my friends knew about it, none of my family members were very concerned or cared at all. I then also mentioned that my teacher, whom my mother really hates, also knows. My father and brother said that they didn't care and didn't see a problem with it. My mother however got really upset and said that I was being very rude. She said that I care more about the teacher than about her. \n\nAITA for not telling my mother about it, and instead telling my teacher who I knew my mother hated? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I woke up today and dealt with a lot of frustrating things around the house, he then had to go to work. I called out because I'm having extremely bad pains that will hopefully go away by tomorrow. We are poor so we cant do much today like \"other couples.\" At work he told me we would spend the night together and I was stoked. He came home and gave me a few kisses, now hes on his ps4 talking to his male friend, which I believe he will be on for the whole night. They typically talk from dusk till dawn but they havent talked for a few weeks. \n\nAITA for feeling frustrated and alone? I'm occupying myself with YouTube, yet cant shake the irritated feeling that I feel. I'm asking yall because I have PTSD issues so it's hard for me understand if these feelings are from my past or not, since I'm so frustrated I almost feel like I'm dreading every minute I'm trying to occupy myself with.\n\nI want to tell him something but dont want to start an argument, because it would offend him and hes having fun. This is just my first valentines day so its huge for me.",

      "description": "This didn't happen today, it happen 3-4 years ago, but I've thought about it pretty often since it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came home from college for the summer, and got invited to a party with some friends from high school. Nothing crazy, just sitting around at this guys house, drinks some beers, all good. There were some people there that I don't know, including a Hispanic guy who, after he arrived, came to sit next to me and started flirting with me (I'm a girl). He was cute, so I flirted back, and we talked for a while until he asked if it would be okay if he went inside to put his bag somewhere. I said yes and joked that it would be fine, as long as he didn't steal anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he went inside, an acquaintance from high school immediately got on my case. He told me what I said was ridiculously racist and offensive, and that he was surprised by me. He said that I needed to apologize the second the guy came back out. I was young and drunk and immediately felt terrible, so when the guy came back, I did apologize profusely. He seemed almost a little confused and accepted it, and we kept talking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I the asshole here? I genuinely didn't intend to make a racist comment- I was drunk and flirting, and my sense of humor and flirting tends to be pretty \"taking the piss out\" of people, so it wasn't something that was out of the ordinary for me to say to someone. But I have felt bad about it ever since and it's one of those things that will keep me up at night, along with other awkward things I've done in the past.",

      "description": "A little back story: I’ve been dating this guy for 2.5 years now. In late October of 2018, he told me he’d like to take a break to focus on applying for jobs. He’s currently working but isn’t happy with the job he has. We’re long-distance, he lives in the States and I live somewhere in Asia.\n\n\nI was against the idea of having a break but he insisted. Both of our parents were against the idea as well.\n\n\nHe was completely cold to me in November and December. I told him each time that if he liked somebody else, or if he met somebody else, it’d be fine for him to tell me. It’d be better than for me to hold onto false hopes and kept on waiting for him. He told me each time that he still cared and loved me, would never cheat nor lie to me, and so on.\n\n\nHe told me that he was home for New Years with his male coworkers who are also his roommates. I found out couple of days later through a video his roommate posted that him and the other coworkers went to Atlanta instead (four hours away from where he lives), and throughout the whole video he was always with a girl. When I confronted him about it, he told me that it was just a video and nothing happened. He then asked me to get back together and invited me to go to Hawaii with his family for his dad’s 60th birthday.\n\n\nI asked him if that was all he lied about and he said yes. I found out a week later that he actually went with the girl in the video to Atlanta during Christmas. His two other coworkers were going as well, but they took different cars. Four people who are going to a destination that’s four hours away taking different cars? Sounded way too silly even for me. When I asked him to explain this, he told me once again that he was sorry he lied and he really forgot that it happened. He told me nothing happened and she just slept throughout the whole car ride.\n\n\nHe told me again and again that he loved me. That he would be getting a green card by the end of the year so I shouldn’t worry about getting a US visa ever again. Anyway, I told him that I was uncomfortable that he was always hanging out with this girl and asked him to stop. He told me he never invited her to outings and that his roommates were always the ones who invited her. I then asked him if his coworkers thought we were broken up or still together—to which he answered his coworkers think we’re still together.\n\n\nLast weekend, he told me he wanted to go to Atlanta again with his roommates to go to IKEA. I asked him not to because I think he should focus on applying for jobs, he’s really bad with controlling his spending, and his room is packed to the point he’d have nowhere to put new furniture in. He told me he’d just be going with the guys and would text me the whole time. On the day of the trip, he told me the girl would be joining them as well.\n\n\nAnd then he never texted me. I texted him multiple times and he never once replied. He replied the next day saying he got back at 2AM, and that he doesn’t love me anymore so he doesn’t see us working out. I was fine with this—but I just wanted some closure and asked him to explain what happened during the Atlanta trip and if he actually cheated and liked the girl. It’s been five days and he never replied.\n\n\nHis roommate posted another video today and I found out they actually spent the night in Atlanta and he didn’t even come back home at 2AM. I sent him an e-mail saying that if he wouldn’t reply to my message, I’d just send the girl a message myself to seek for explanations for her. He replied to my messages in 2 minutes. Two fucking minutes. Said he was sorry, he was busy, he likes her. He’s saying he likes her after he told me he loves me and asked me to get back together.\n\n\nI told him I’d send his mom and the girl messages anyway because he ruined my life. I wasted three months of my life on him cause he said he loved me and he wanted to get back together and not. I lost 5 kilograms, cried myself to sleep every single night. He begged me and told me to not please send them messages and he asked me how he even ruined my life.\n\n\nI think I acted out of pure angriness but I sent his mom and the girl messages anyway. I’m not sure if the girl thinks he’s single or if she knows he’s still together with someone but is fine seeing him anyway. I thought I’d feel better after sending it but I just feel so bitter and childish, but I feel like if the girl didn’t know—then she should.\n\n\nAITA and did I cross the line?",

      "description": "A few friends and I went to Vegas for a weekend trip, and hit up a strip club on Saturday night. I'm not as well-off financially as my friends. My friends were planning on having a good time with strippers, but I decided I wasn't going to pay for any potential services, and instead just enjoy hanging out with my buddies. I tried to make that pretty clear to the strippers who approached me. Though I enjoyed chatting with them, and they seemed to enjoy chatting with me too, even after I told them I wasn't going to pay for anything (I ended up having a few 15 minute long conversations). But then there was this interaction:\n\nA stripper approaches me, and asks what I'm looking for.\n\nI respond, \"I don't know, how much are your services?\"\n\n\"It depends on what you want...how about about a few thousand?\"\n\n\"That's a bit steep for me, I'm more of a hundreds kind of guy\"\n\n\"That's fine, we can work something out...\"\n\nAt this point, I was wavering in my commitment to not spend any money. She takes me for a walk around the club. We've interacted for no more than 2-3 minutes total at this point.\n\nShe asks again what I want to do. I've changed my mind again, and decide that I don't want anything after all. I tell her this.\n\nShe calls me out, saying that I had just said a few minutes prior that I'd pay her for \\*something\\*. I realize I'm being unfair and leading her on, so I'm direct tell her that I'm sorry for changing my mind, and that I'm not feeling it anymore.\n\nShe is now incredulous: \"Why did you come to a strip club if you weren't planning on spending money?!?\" (fair question...but I came mostly to spend more time with my friends in a new environment) and \"how dare you touch me?\" (I was holding her arm prior to this point, but had not touched any other part of her body)\n\nI apologize again, and she immediately follows up by demanding that I tip her. She didn't specify an amount she wanted, but kept reiterating that I wasted her time. I only had a $20 and $50 bill in my wallet, and didn't think that either justified the opportunity cost of her time (around 5 minutes total at this point), so I told her that I couldn't tip her and I'm again sorry.\n\nI realize I cost her time that she could've spent with another potential \"client,\" but I find it a bit absurd that she demanded me to tip her just for 5 minutes of conversation (especially since I had spent significantly longer talking to some of her fellow strippers, who didn't make any demand of tipping)? I imagine she spends a nontrivial amount of time each night not interacting with any clients at all (e.g. walking around, drinking, etc.), and that it's also not uncommon for potential clients to turn her down.\n\nAITA for not paying a hard working individual?\n\ntl;dr Unexpectedly shafted a stripper. I spent 5 minutes talking to her, and refuse her services. She demands that I tip her for her time. I don't have an appropriate amount to tip her, so I refuse. AITA?",

      "description": "Horrible title, I know. \n\nI have a friend who started off her pet collection with a beautiful Husky. She got him as a gift and at first everything was well. After a few months it became very apparent that he’s a very energetic dog and he spent the next 2 years of his life stuck for 12+ hours in a crate because her family did not want to take care of him. It was her dog, her responsibility. She works a full time job with overtime so you can imagine how much time this poor dog was alone. \n\nFast forward to today: he’s still quite energetic (gotten much better) but he’s slightly aggressive towards people and honestly he scares me whenever I go over. \n\nShe has since moved out on her own, which is great for her imo, but now she has a collection of animals.  \n\nWhen she moved out she took her Husky with her and another family dog. This little guy (a smaller mix) is aggressive towards other dogs and pees everywhere. He’s such a sweetheart when you give him attention but when you ignore him he’s a total asshole. He barks, destroys shoes and other items, will be aggressive towards the other pets, etc. And of course, she says he’s an asshole most of the time and has even commented in the past about wanting to give him up (she’s had this little one since before acquiring the Husky). \n\nOver the course of her living on her own, she now has 4 animals total. 2 dogs and 2 cats. I don’t go over anymore because it’s become too much. The dogs fight over attention and the cats are every (which is typical for cats, no complaints there). \n\nThis is where my problem lies:\n\nShe’s had issues with her front door and her animals escape. It’s happened on more than one occasion. The Husky has escaped like 3 times. Every time I get phone calls with her freaking out and crying. She’s managed to find him everyone. Now, this past weekend one of her cats escaped because her husky ran out the door and she chased after it leaving the door open. \n\nThese animals have provided her emotional support through very tough times and I know she loves them very dearly. They hold a lot of sentimental value to her - especially that Husky. However, it breaks my heart to say that I don’t think she’s a good pet owner. She can barely manage that Husky let alone 4 animals total. \n\nI have expressed that maybe getting more animals isn’t the best thing. She talks about needing money, working more overtime along with other things that just lead me to believe that these animals aren’t getting the attention they need. \n\nSo everytime one of them escapes, a little part inside me hopes that she doesn’t find them because maybe they’ll be better off in a new home. Obviously I haven’t told her this, she’d be destroyed. But I just can’t help it.\n\nAITA for feeling this way? ",

      "description": "So some background info, basically we're all in college and I'm already broke as it is. Usually in college you might get a card and a little present from a your friend and you'd be ecstatic. But it's coming up on this girl's bday and it's her first bday away from home, given that our school is only 2 hours from her hometown and she's going home the weekend after her bday anyway, it didn't seem that big a deal to me. But she made this giant deal about how her mom always decorates her room with streamers and balloons on her b'day and she doesnt know how she's gonna cope without that. Then she offered to buy her own decorations if we put them up, which means she basically expects a giant celebration. We had already gotten her a card and gifts and we're gonna leave it at that, but now she wants this too. Her mom even texted us to make sure we were doing something, b/c her daughter would be so heartbroken if this didn't happen. \nThen she casually mentions how excited she was for her bday trip to the beach this year, and we were like yeah! I'm sure you'll have fun! And she then mentioned how we were going to and we were very confused given she had never mentioned this trip and also never asked us to go? The trip is next week and frankly I'm a big planner so this is very last mintue for me, i kind of just wanted the stay on campus to finish my he that weekend, I was never asked to go, and I'm pretty annoyed with her at the moment anyways for a variety of other reasons so I really don't want to go. The trip is also supposed to be somewhere that takes about a 3-1/2 hour drive for a one night trip and it's pretty expensive which I know her mom can't afford right now. She also keeps changing the plan every 3 seconds. So I just want to know, AITA for wanting to skip out? ",

      "description": "I took a computer science course this year of high school (junior). I went into this class actually interested in computer science, but her class ruined it for me. She spends the entire period on her laptop and expects us to read the entire lesson and figure it out on our own. Maybe I am being an entitled high schooler but I thought teachers were paid to teach and not sit on their computer all day while the students figure it out on their own. Almost the entire class agrees with me and thinks the exact same thing i do. This is also a private school where tuition is very expensive (6-8k a year). I feel like my parents are getting straight robbed because of this one class. This is what the email says “You act like its our fault that we don’t know the answers even though you never teach us anything. You spend all class on your computer instead of teaching us and get mad when we decide to do other work during the period. You act like we should be able to read the lesson and understand it on our own.” ",

      "description": "So \"Jesse\"(m42) and I(m37) have been friends for going on 20 years. I'm the entrepreneurial type, he's the just keep your head down and work hard and the American dream will automatically come type. Jesse has 3 jobs. He works at a car wash during the day, then parks trucks for UPS, then finishes off most his nights doing valet for a restaurant.\n\n The car wash is the 8-year gig. Jesse works hard asf. He's never late, never calls in sick, always down to come in on his days off if he's called in. Super trooper for real. The problem is, his starting wage was $7.25/hr....fast forward 8 years he now makes $8.15/hr. To add insult to injury the employees must split tips. And since washing cars is such a menial profession he's the 42-year-old working hard to survive while surrounded by co-workers who are mostly fuck ups or high school kids on break who just don't care. \n\nHe's the workhorse and his employers take advantage of it full tilt. If he wants a day off to go check out the Bengals(his fave team) he damn near has to beg. When he's tried to bring up raises in the past management manipulates him into thinking his requests are non-sensical. Almost every day he tells me the BS he has to deal with from managers and co-workers and almost every day I tell him how he deserves better and should look for better but he kind of shuts down when I make these suggestions.\n\n So a couple days ago he comes to my place all smiles and suuuper excited. Like \"bro, guess what happened at work.\" I'm thinking ohhhh shit, this mf finally got a raise. He tells me that their busy as all hell when the owner pulls up and gets out of his car looking pissed as fire. As soon as he gets out he points at Jesse and orders him over to the car, hands on his waist pacing back and forth clearly irritated. According to Jesse he literally runs over to the owners car. When Jesse gets over there, the owner switches up and begins to explain how much he appreciates Jesse for his hard work and YEARS of dedication to the business.\n\n The owner then tosses Jesse the keys to the car and pauses for a moment. Long enough of a moment to give Jesse the thought that the owner just gave him the car. The owner then chuckles and says nahhh I cant give you the beamer but I got you something else, open the trunk and check it out. Jesse takes the keys, opens up the trunk,(Again I'm thinking to myself like...it better be a kilo of bam bam or at least 3 mac book pros in that bitch) and feasts his eyes on...a mf'n air fryer.\n\n Jesse is telling me this shit like he's the luckiest dude in the world, and I, somewhat regrettably so begin to dismantle every bit of his excitement by describing how much of an insult and slap in the face this \"gift\" from his employer is. I'm telling him shit like \"you should've thrown that air fryer across the damn street and told him to go fuck himself\" etc etc. My rant probably lasted 3 minutes and at the end of it I look at his face and he looks embarrassed and somewhat ashamed. He's not looking at me while he say's \"well I thought it was pretty cool I really wanted one of those things\". I again go into explaining why he should feel disrespected and not appreciated until I snap out of it. Then he tells me maybe I'm right, followed by \"well I gotta get to my other job\" but I really feel like he just left because I shit all over his good day. What's your take? AITA\n\nTL:DR Friend of mine has been working at a place that's given him less than a dollar raise in 8 years. Owner gives him an air fryer to show appreciation. My friend feels good about it until I make him feel bad about it. ",

It used to be A LOT worse, &amp; he’s gotten better which i congratulate him on often, but is still a bit of an issue. He’s an impulsive buyer, doesn’t think about his purchases much, doesn’t buy the cheapest option out of the 2, eats out quite a bit, buys coffee, takes unnecessary toll roads (which are expensive in Sydney) etc. So never HUGE purchases, just small purchases that really add up over time.\n\nWe both don’t make great income (combined, maybe 80k at most) and we’re trying to save for a house and travel. We have about 75k~ savings, however, when we got married, we combined our incomes &amp; I contributed about 65k to that amount. He gets really confused “where his money goes even though he puts away $500 a week,” which of course is impossible as he’d have WAY more saved if he really did save a grand a week- so theres some cognitive dissonance going on there. \n\nI tell him bluntly, but compassionately that he’s spending more than he realises &amp; to download the same spending app the I have to have a comprehensive write up on where his money is going. This doesn’t go down well, he tells me I'm being controlling, condescending &amp; treating him like my son &amp; not an adult &amp; that he doesn’t tell me how to spend my money so I shouldn’t do that to him. I would never “forbid” or tell him what to do, but its really affecting our saving efforts so I just gave him a suggestion, seeing as its what I do &amp; it works as, before we married, I had significantly greater savings than he did. Am I really being controlling &amp; in the wrong?\n\nTL;DR- told my husband he spends way too much money, told him how he can save &amp; he told me i'm being controlling.",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile.\n\nIm an arborist. For those who dobt know i trim/remove trees.\n\nToday we had a job trimming three rather large trees at a customers house. Biung we were working in Denver, we have to keep the street and sidewalk clear of the brush we cut down. We had one guy in a lift bucket on one tree, one guy climbing the second,  and a guy on the roof cutting the third tree. So brush is constantly falling and im continuously running around grapping the brush throwing it in the chipper and keeing the walk and street clear.\n\nCustomers neighbor comes up to me as askes if we can chip some limbs, he has about 20 of them ranging fron 6 to 10 feet. Honestly about 5 minuts of work and our chip truck was still close to empty. So i told him i would for $20, (would split it with rest of crew) which is very fair considering the convienance and the time im taking away from our current (paying) customer. \n\nHe didnt believe that was fair, cause all i had to do was just stick them in our chipper, hardly any work at all. He didnt want to pay that, so i said \" sorry sir, cont do it for free.\" He called me an asshole, and i got back to work.\n\nThe thing is, i take pride in my work. (Our whole crew does). This is a trade skill, a lot of time and hard work goes into this job, especally to get certified. I love my job but i wont do it for free. I doubt he would ask a plumber, electrician, or a mechanic for some quick free work, i dont see my line of work any different.\n\nTldr;\nCustomers neighbor asked if i could chip his brush while were at it, i told him i would for $20.

      "title": "AITA for being angry with my wife for mistakenly causing our child to poke herself in the eye with a fork?",
      "description": "About two nights ago, my wife and I were eating dinner at home with our nearly three year old daughter. Our daughter was screwing around like a typical toddler and reached for my wife's fork. My wife held on to the fork and was asking our daughter what she wanted while holding onto it. Our daughter kept pulling it toward her, and during this whole thing the fork ended up in the air with the point end at toddler-head level and both of them pulling on the fork. I saw what was about to happen and started to say \"Don't let go!\", but only got to \"D-\" as my wife let the fork go, and the force from our daughter pulling  pulled it right into her cheekbone. The fork came within a half inch of her eye.\n\nI immediately got silent and gathered my words because my first thought was to ask my wife what in the name of God's fucking fuck was going through her head, but I stayed calm. She apologized to our daughter and felt bad, but was apologizing in the same tone you might use if you accidentally tripped a kid or something minor like that.\n\nWhen my wife finally asked me if something was wrong, I let out a sigh because I knew this was going to start a fight, and I said in an annoyed tone, \"She almost got poked in the eye\". Wife starts talking about how she didn't see that the fork was pointed at her eye, how she \"can't always see 5 steps ahead\", and in my eyes making excuses. Then she told me \"it's like how you forget to not pick her up by her arms after she got injured\", and I got really pissed.\n\nShe was referring to about a month ago, our daughter was pulling me around in a restaurant and she turned her arm wrong and got a minor dislocation in her elbow. We went to the ER, it turned out to be minor and we were out within an hour. And in the month since then I've forgotten a few times about the doctor's orders not to pick her up by the arms. \n\nSo she told me that her negligently almost causing our daughter to lose or damage her eyesight is the same as me forgetting what the doctor said and risking a minor childhood injury with about 1 in 100000 chance of actually happening. In an angry tone, not yelling, I told her it really bothered me that she equated the two and tried to turn my anger at the situation around on me. She said I was talking to her like I'm so superior, and I told her in an angry voice that \"I don't just wait around for you to fuck up so I can be like 'oh I'm so much better than wife's name', me forgetfully risking a minor injury is not the same as LOSS OF SIGHT!\". \n\nAfter that I walked away from the dinner table, we went about our daily routines, but now we haven't been talking to each other.\n\nBackground story:\n\nMy wife tends to not pick up after herself and likes to leave things in a place of least effort. This extends to food on the counter, knives on the counter, cups left in the bathroom, etc. I tend to nag my wife about leaving stuff out, and I tend to not filter my words, we've had a few fights about this. Once our daughter started getting old enough to reach the counter I started getting more on my wife's case about leaving things on the counter and not paying attention. One day, my wife left a bowl of hot soup on the counter and our daughter reached up and dunked her entire hand into the soup. Luckily she only got first degree burns, but she was crying really hard and my wife felt terrible. I was furious with her and we had a very serious argument, and similarly she tried to turn it against me by saying that I was being unfair. That her guilt should be enough and she shouldn't have to be made to feel like shit, that I should support her. We talked bout it and worked it out eventually. \n\nI feel justified in my anger, and because of this and the soup incident I feel like my wife's absent-mindedness might someday lead to a really serious injury. She feels like it wasn't a big deal. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": " My friend set me up with an ex coworker of hers because I was telling her how hard it was to find someone to date after leaving college and working on a very male-dominated field.\n\nWe hit it off pretty good and we went on two pretty good dates. We had lots in common and the conversation flowed naturally between us. One thing that ticked me off though was that she had a slight “princess” attitude when we first started talking, but I figured it wasn’t that big of a deal.\n\nWell, during the third date we’re at a restaurant and she’s complaining about something on her phone that’s not working. I’m good with tech so I start suggesting things for her to do and try to fix it and she just snaps out of nowhere and screams at me “I ALREADY DID THAT!” Of course everyone turns to look at us and I’m just cringing and trying to ignore it. I ask for the check and drop her home (she wanted me to come in but I said I was tired and needed to sleep).\n\nNext day she starts texting me like nothing happened asking what I wanna do this week and so I just sent her a text saying something along the lines of “Hey I think you’re a great girl but this is not really working for me, good luck!” And she just responds “Fuck you” (LOL).\n\nNow, I don’t give a shit about her tbh but now my friend called me and said I was an asshole and that I’m exaggerating for dumping her after a single outburst. Am I exaggerating and being an asshole or is the girl in question the asshole here? Or are we all just a bunch of assholes?",

I just randomly saw it as an event on Facebook \n\nI am not one to be the center of attention and I usually don’t like the spotlight to be on me. I usually just like my accomplishments to be known but not recognized. I usually don’t like to make a big to-do of my birthday or anything like that. Didn’t really want to have a graduation party for high school, mom threw one anyway. Didn’t have one for college, I was fine. \n\nI know that I won’t be coming home often and it would be nice for everyone that wants to see me to be able to come and chat for a little while but I’m just not into it. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I just asked my mom to call the whole thing off completely and we just go out to eat with a smaller group of friends or family. She’s had it planned for a few days now and I don’t want to hurt her or anyone else that planned on seeing me or seem selfish just because I don’t want something but I just don’t like these events or whatever you want to call them.

My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn’t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. “Evaluated for what? There’s nothing wrong with my child.” I’m not trying to pry but she’s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can’t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I’m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? ",

G said his friend had \"no class\" and specifically said \"you can say all the shit you want about me, but you don't touch family.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntoday, someone came up to G and was almost about to fight him because G made a joke to a peer about his brother going back to his war-torn country.  G knew he didnt know the full story and he knew he was making an insensitive joke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nafter, i met with 2 of my friends (T and B) and T said that G was being super hypocritical and he shouldn't have touched family at all, especially since he made a big deal about his sister. i didn't agree at first but after her explaining it to me, i realized how bad that is. B said she'd talk to him about it, and i said straight up to her \"G needs to shape up\". i had to leave immediately because i was meeting someone across town, so i said bye, hugged everyone and was on my way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhen i got home i got a text from T saying that \"B kinda got offended nd feels bad that you just said G needs to shape up\". i was confused, so after asking her, she responded with \"she said you made her feel bad about her relationship\". i told her i'd apologize to B but i'm not taking back what i said about G. i texted B and she said that it's fine and she's over it, but i still feel like there's a lot of tension. am i the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummary: my friend's boyfriend has previously been defensive of people insulting his family. however, he made an insensitive joke about someone else's brother. in a discussion about the situation, i told my friend that her boyfriend needs to shape up. she said i made her feel bad about her relationship. i then apologized but i feel like there's still tension. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A little backstory: I'm 39f, my husband is 53. His son is 30 and his son's GF is 28. She's expecting a baby boy in March. They've been visiting more since she became pregnant and I'm delighted every time they come. My husband and I have been together for 14 years. \n\nSo last night my husband and I had his son and his girlfriend over. They brought their puppy to play with our dog, we ordered pizza, had drinks, and I thought it was really fun. I will say that I got tipsy, but I wasn't drunk, and I'm not a mean or offensive person when drinking. I do have a little social anxiety, and sometimes I talk too much. My husband cut me off and talked over me several times while I was telling a random story, or just replying to something. Always while I was speaking to his son. \n\nAfter they left I asked him about this, as it's not at all the first time, and it really bothers me. His answer is that when I drink I \"go on and on\" about things. Basically he made me feel like I annoy his family and that I bother him. I told him that although he hadn't said exactly that, that's how he makes me feel. Also, in doing that, I'm realizing that I think he's made me feel like his son doesn't like me. I've always felt a bit out of place around him, and I think that may be part of the reason why. \n\nIn any case, we got into a big argument about it. I do know that I talk too much sometimes, and I don't want to bore people. So, AITA? Should I really just shut up? His son visits to see him, not me, anyways. I'm just at a loss. \n",

      "description": "It’s seriously two days before Christmas.. I’m stressed because I’ve had projects planned for gifts since October and I have not gone a single week without working on homemade gifts in our guest room/my arts and crafts room. My husband has his office with his games and electronics while I like to go upstairs in this room and claim it for my own pleasurable, creative, get-away zone. All but a few gifts are completed by now, but there’s a few special ones I was planning to make for my husband—involving a black and white photo collage of his very beloved deceased grandparents—and among fun times with friends and family—these are not done yet.\n\nEvery time I’ve been in that room, my husband thinks it’s funny to mess with me by opening the door and waltzing in with his eyes closed or doing a little spin so he can’t see anything but jokingly will try me. He knows I’ve been in this room each week doing Christmas things. It was cute the first few times but this is serious for me right now with Christmas around the corner. These gifts are very sentimental, even for me while making them..\n\nIt was after Thanksgiving that I accidentally walked into his office to talk but he was wrapping some gifts for me. He made a quick yelp and without another thought I quickly shut my eyes and closed the door, turning away and apologizing. I didn’t see a thing. I scampered off to do something else in the mean time.\n\nFast forward to last night. My husband wanted his guys over for their own gift exchanges. I said that’s fine and I left them to it to go upstairs and work without interruptions. I found it to be delightful to be alone to my crafts after hostessing our house an early Christmas to our local families earlier in the day. I was running off of 5 hours of crappy sleep. The boys got very rowdy playing games, had a few beers, and 4 hours later left the house. I’m still in the guest room, now feeling flustered that one of the frames isn’t cooperating with my crafting, when my husband slams open the door to come into the room with wide goofy eyes. I quickly scramble up to his view because his gifts are EVERYWHERE in sight with my mess. He doesn’t even close his eyes or turn around like normal. He steps forward and I ask him to please leave. He does not. His eyes dart around behind me and I’m getting upset as he takes a few more steps into the room before looking back at me and asking: why I’m still up here working, it’s been hours!, why can’t we hang out, what am I doing and what is all this stuff, before lastly stating that he didn’t see anything (all while still shuffling to get past me). I became a little irate at this and started stepping into him to back out of the room and leave. I shut the door while I hear him complaining down the hall about how mean I was and that I ruined his evening.\n\nI calmed down and closed up “shop” to go talk to him. I’ve been working really hard to not lose my cool in conversation lately. A little self-care/self-practice if you will. And to also have reasonable thoughts to back up my claims as I tend to get emotional fast and fly off the hook, inappropriately. At this point, I’ve calmly explained my feelings to my husband.. that he firstly didn’t knock and had disrespected me and my boundaries when I asked him to leave the room, that he’s blaming me for ruining yet another one of his Christmases because I can’t blow this thing off, that I’m upset he can’t hold himself accountable for his actions knowing damn well what I was doing in that room as if anything has changed over the past two months, and that this little game of his isn’t cute or funny anymore and he has disappointed me at this point. I honestly don’t even know why I tried so hard this Christmas... \n\nAlthough I might have yelled or snapped a little in the moment I needed him to leave my crafts, not once did I ever raise my voice during our conversation about why I felt upset and instead he just kept raving and blaming me for it all. I tried using that time I walked in on him as a perfect example of respecting someone enough to leave the room...but forget about it. He wasn’t having it.\n\nSo now I guess ITA for once again ruining this favorite holiday of my husband’s because I take my preparations to give him a great day too seriously and “freak out”. Every last 8 years.\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my friend and I decided earlier this week to hang out tomorrow and I would spend the night at her place. Today while we were texting, she mentioned she wants to go to happy hour with her work team tomorrow after work and that it could potentially interfere with our hangout. \n\nI live very far away from her and get up early for work (we both work for the same company so she gets up at the same time as me). Because I live so far from her and she said the happy hour could end up going late, I said it wouldn't make sense for me to go to her place once she's done with happy hour, which I agreed. Right now we've agreed that I'll bring sleepover stuff and if happy hour goes too late, I'll just go back home.\n\nAfter we agreed with this, I told her I was annoyed with the fact that she was changing plans on me and that I would not have done the same to her. She argued that if the roles were reversed, she wouldn't have minded me going to happy hour. I completely disagree with her on this and think when you make plans with someone, you shouldn't make new plans with anyone else that could possibly interfere with yours.\n\nShe also asked me if I'd rather she just not go to happy hour and hang out with me and I told her no because it was obvious she wants to go to HH. I get I kind of shot myself in the foot here, but I dont want to stop her from doing something she really wants to either.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? AITA for overreacting or am I justified here.",

      "description": "My dad is 63 and recently decided to \"retire.\" The only problem with this is he's been sitting around, watching native YouTube videos, and seems rather depressed.\n\nHe's turned to food as his vice. He's constantly hungry. Most of our food in the house is Paleo, and rather expensive, and he's been plowing through it like there's no tomorrow. I am a Nursing student and generally take care of very sick (mostly due to avoidable conditions!) people who chose not to take care of themselves in their adult-life. These people are, in all honesty, a burden to the healthcare system (can't walk because their so obese, have to wait on them hand and foot like it's a hotel!) and I fear throwing out my back or knee helping them stand up on a regular basis.\n\nSo, when I got home from clinical and noticed and entire bag of unopened chips and cream cheese missing, I lost it. I told him I'm not going to take care of him when he is old and sick if he doesn't take care of himself. However, I also live under his roof and he pays for the food. He got very angry with me and said I had no right to tell him what to eat. He is not speaking to me right now because he's so hurt \"I would disrespect him like this.\"\n\nHe is not obese, but has non-alcoholic fatty liver (he looks pregnant) which is sure to lead down the road to some painful illnesses. He is also diabetic. I worry for him mostly about liver and kidney failure. I also have become a little obsessive over diet/weight since I've seen truly how bad it can get in one's life when you don't take care of yourself.\n\nAITA since I live in his house that I don't have the right to monitor how he eats?

Up until a few years ago I really loved my grandmother, but then my mom opened up to me about her childhood.  My mother was physically and emotionally abused by my grandmother, and then kicked out and forced to live with my grandfather (they're divorced, as my grandma cheated on him), where my mother was physically abused by her step-mother.  Basically, my grandma is a terrible person by all accounts.  But when my mother was an adult, my grandma got sick (multiple sclerosis) and saw it as a sort of punishment from God and tried to be better.  Considering she cleaned up her act and only wanted to be a loving grandmother, my mom decided we should have a relationship with her, and she really has always been sweet to me.  The fact is, I've never been able to look at her the same way since my mom told me about how she treated her.  My boyfriend says I should answer her texts since she's old and doesn't see much of anyone due to her MS -- she can't get around so well.  He also thinks I'm being a dick since my mom has clearly forgiven her, but the way my mom looked when she told me about her past, I really don't think she has.

We can't afford a car for me, she needs her car and even if I could buy one the insurance would kill me. So we decided a phone would be more appropriate as mine is quite old and on it's way out (it's from the whole family). We can get a contract deal for cheap so I could afford it going into University. \n\nShe just came to me like 30 minutes ago saying she discussed it with the family and they were going to get me driving lessons. Her reasoning was that I could just get refresher lessons once I can afford a car and could get a job as a delivery driver and it would save a lot of hassle when I actually get a car. I disagree because my phone won't last much longer ( it's 5 years old now and very slow) and I won't be able to afford to replace it in Uni, there are other jobs that don't require a car and the public transport in the city I'm going to is very good. I believe I need something that will help me whilst I'm strapped for money as a student as opposed to something I can save for later.  I'm going off what I saw with my cousin who was in a very similar situation to me. She got lessons, ended up not using a car all through Uni and now is scared to drive. \n\nSo AITA for wanting a gift that could help me in the next few years which I'll believe I need it as opposed to a gift that I can get once I'm out of Uni. \n\n I'm not ungrateful, it's just our family doesn't have much money and I'd rather the money not go to waste on something I could save for.",

I sort of think to myself that the random gifts I give them are early/late birthday presents.\n\nMy sister and her husband told me to stop bringing them expensive gifts like that. They basically told me that they don't appreciate it and to stop doing it. I asked why and they told me that they're their parents. I make a lot more money than either of them, but they're not hurting for money so I don't think it's really a financial issue thing.\n\nAsk for details if needed",

      "description": "So a little background, I’m 14 years old. I have a 12 year old brother, a 12 year old step-sister, and a 10 year old sister. Around a year ago my mom and this guy she’s known for a while started dating, he moved in and immediately decided he was the boss of the house, we were renting out downstairs room to a woman and her boyfriend, she was pregnant. My stepdad didn’t like her because she didn’t eat healthy, and always left her chicken strip tray on top of the oven, which I was always kind of annoyed by, but I never said anything because it wasn’t that big of a deal, he ended up kicking her out leaving her with no where to go, and she was still pregnant.\n\nIt’s always been small things, like whenever he drives us somewhere he’ll smoke in the car and say “don’t tell your mother” or he will call me “a generation z snowflake” because I don’t like to eat mashed potatoes because of the texture, or he will pick up my sister from school on a rainy day, and when I try to get in the car he says “walk home, she’s younger” or telling me and my brother multiple times that my sister is his favourite \n\nI’ve always thought he treated my sister unfairly, he makes her clean less, and makes her do less in general, he’s always said that “She’s younger so she doesn’t have to clean until she’s older” and I get that, but when he tells me to clean the entire living room, scrub the kitchen floor, and clean for four hours, even if you finish all your chores I expect a minimum of four hours, (Not an over exaggeration, really what he said) when all my sister has to do is clean her room (which I have to do too) it just seems a little unfair, he does my sisters laundry, all she has to do is tidy her room. Half a year ago my new step sister moved in, and she is the same age as my brother, her only job is to clean her room. \n\nThe other night it was my turn to do the dishes, which I’m fine with, but my brother was saying to me “do the dishes means clean up everything  after dinner” and I knew that wasn’t true, so we argued about it before I got upset and left because he was blatantly lying to do less work. After like five minutes I came back to finish the rest of the dishes and my brother had gotten my stepdad, he told my brother that dishes didn’t mean the whole kitchen, so he apologized, and I finished the dishes, I started to go to my room when my stepdad said “You have to finish the rest of the kitchen”  I asked him why, he didn’t explain, after the last year of him treating me unfairly and making me do so much more (not just a little bit, a lot.) I got really pissed off and I yelled at him (I don’t remember what) and I left the room.\n\n\nTLDR my stepdad makes me and my brother clean more than my sister, his excuse is we are older, stepdad adopts kid same age as my brother, and he makes her do way less than him, stepdad tells me to clean the entire kitchen after dinner while everyone else just has to clean their plate, this wasn’t a one off thing, every other day me and my brother do at least ten times more than my sisters, and I’m not exaggerating \n\nSo I just want to know am I the asshole? \n If you have any questions about this, please ask\n",

      "description": "So I was having a few friends over from college at my place for a couple of drinks and basically just hanging around. The evening passes and one of my female friends was starting to get really drunk which I may have noticed a little too late, otherwise I may have said something to prevent that. At this point 2 of my friends already left and only me, the drunk girl and her best friend were the ones left. I asked her best friend what's the right thing to do here because she could hardly walk and we agreed on them both sleeping over at my place while her best friend was taking care of her.\n\n I absolutely knew this option would not have been approved by my girlfriend who was out of town, but I really felt it was the right thing to do. Because I didn't know how my girlfriend would react if I told her, I didn't tell her at all and just texted her I was going to bed and went to sleep on my couch while the other two slept in my bed.\n\nWell, a few days pass and my girlfriend calls me and asked my if I had anything else to say about that night. I immediately realised she had found out about this whole situation (probably from the girls best friend). I confessed and explained her every detail and why I let them both sleep over at my place, still thinking this was the right thing to do and her being understanding about it. She was absolutely furious about this and didn't talk to me for a few days.\n\n5 months have passed since this night and our relationship has ever since kinda been shitty, she says she doesn't trust anymore, controls me when I go out with friends and is basically really suspicious about every little interaction with other girls. Any further explanation on why I handeled the situation like I did hasn't changed anything on the current situation.\n\nAm I really the asshole and handeled the situation badly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So me and my girlfriend has been dating for almost a year. We were talking last night and I knew she was feeling down. I was on the phone with her being understanding and trying to make her feel better. I really tried my best to make her feel better, but it wasn’t working so we ended up talking about random stuff.\n\n I recently got a new job and have been extremely stressed over it. In order to make any money I would need to close deals. Sometimes I get work calls at night when I’m not at the office. She had to go help her mom with something so she hung up. When she hung up I got a work related call with one of a lead I’ve been working on. The call went great, there’s a high chance that because of that call that I’d be closing this deal by the end of the week. \n\nI was really really excited and happy after I got off the phone. Mainly because if I close this deal it’ll be my first one. Without thinking I called my girlfriend and told her what just happened. She was happy for me. Later she sent me a text saying how it wasn’t fair that I told her the great news that happened to means how great I was feeling when she was in a bad mood. I genuinely forgot that she was in a bad mood. I feel like a bad boyfriend. I told her that I’m sorry and didn’t mean for it to make her feel worst. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for cutting ties with my BFF because of my boyfriend?",
      "description": "This happened a while back, but I thought I could reflect on this and look for other opinions. \nLast summer, I reached a tipping point with my best friend of almost 10 years, and I pretty much cut her off. We got along super well, had the same interests, and never ran out of things to talk about. However, she was pretty spoiled and sometimes acted like a brat, and I always felt like she had a weird superiority complex. She hated herself, but also thought of herself as above others. If you weren't her friend, you were scum. I hated that about her, but I never saw that side of her until high school, so I always saw it as the freshman rebellion phase. I tried to push past that because I thought she'd eventually outgrow it.\nOn the day of reckoning, she messaged me on Snapchat because she realized my boyfriend wasn't showing up on her friends list. He had blocked her because she's one of those people that sends you whatever she puts on her story, and he'd already asked her to stop, and she probably forgot and kept doing it. I told her if she'd asked him and stopped spamming, he probably would've unblocked her. However, instead of asking me to remove the block, she proceeds to *yell* at me through Snapchat, in all caps. In my 10 years with her, it was the first time she called me a cunt and a bitch and got angry with me. I was so shocked that it took me a minute to respond and tell her it was uncalled for; I didn't get anywhere with her though, because all she wanted to do was insult and harass my boyfriend for something he would've reversed in a split second if she'd asked nicely. I stopped responding after that. \nIt didn't end there, though. Later that week, I went with my boyfriend to Target so I could get paper for a project I wanted to start on. And of course that was the night *she* was also there. She had this look on her face, so I went to express checkout and sent my boyfriend to take something back. She comes up to me, and starts yelling at me. In front of everyone in Target. \"Oh, so you don't want to talk? Whatever, you need to stop taking up for your boyfriend automatically. I stayed by your side even when you did that with your ex\" (Mind you, it was an unhealthy, abusive relationship with my ex at the time she was talking about). I decide to respond that it was unnecessary to call me names for something so petty, and all she had to respond was that maybe I deserved it. I stopped paying attention at that point, and all I could do was sheepishly apologize to the cashier. I had a panic attack after that and cried for 5 minutes.\nThe next day, I unfollowed and blocked her on all social media because she's the type to talk mad shit. I even texted our group of friends my side of the story so they'd know why I'd stopped coming to our get-togethers. It kind of hurt that all but one person didn't respond to it. \nThis was the first time I had to actively end a friendship. Every other relationship kind of drifted off, so I really don't know how else I could've reacted. Was it okay for me to end it? This old friend is one of those people that would probably get an ego-boost from me dragging myself back; she would've done it if I'd told her about the bad stuff that happened with my ex and 'told me so.'\n\nTLDR: I cut ties with my long-term friend because she verbally harassed me and my boyfriend over something that we could've easily fixed without malice.",

Jane lives upstairs in the bedroom right next to ours and shares a bathroom with my fiance and I.\n\nJane lives 1000 km away and once she's done her exams in three weeks, she plans on moving back home for the summer with her boyfriend. She signed a lease from August 2018-August 2019, so she has to find someone to take over the remainder of her share of the lease in order to leave. She found someone solid ready to sign the lease, but when I creeped him on facebook he was this super wannabe thug looking guy. White guy, but just imagine the classic look that would make an old lady clutch her pearls. His pictures with all his friends looked, well trashy, for a lack of a better term, and captioned with things like \"trap life\". We were a bit put off by this, but we decided to not judge a book by its cover and meet the guy/give him a fair chance. He came over to meet us, and while he still looked like someone who I would cross to the other side of the street if I saw him walking towards me at night, he was nice and seemed pretty chill. But then he mentions that he has a breathalyzer installed in his car due to a past DUI, red flag number 1. Shortly thereafter my (tiny) dog was sitting on his lap and he was petting her, but then my cat jumped onto the back of the couch and hissed at the dog. This guy proceeds to SHOVE my dog off of him onto the floor pretty aggressively. I was super stunned by this but no one said anything and I was feeling A LOT of pressure from Jane to just accept this guy so she could leave in three weeks. We tell Jane that we'll let her know, but I'm just so uncomfortable with this dude. She thinks I'm just being judgemental. I told Jane I would look for someone else for her and found a girl to come look at the room on Friday, but she was pissed because she just wants to be able to leave. I understand her frustrations and it's definitely a shitty situation for her. But at the same time I'm the one who has to sleep in the room right next to this guy for 5 months, who knows what kind of riff raff he'll bring into this house, he clearly makes poor choices if he had a serious enough DUI to get a breathalyzer installed, and he pushed my dog! Jane is mad at me but like... I'm offering to help find someone! If it delays her moving out until the end of April instead of mid April, I'm sorry, but I just really don't feel comfortable with this guy. Am I the asshole here? Am I being too judgemental? \n\nTLDR; Roommate wants a guy who gives me the heebie jeebies to take over her room for the summer, but he makes poor choices (has a breathalyzer installed in his car), shoved my dog onto the floor, and looks like he has riff raff for friends.",

I keep bringing it up and he seems to get frustrated and almost angry, (and background on me, I'm a huge pushover) so I stay quiet and try not to raise my voice and when i do he's more angry and frustrated. \n\nI've told him to go to the doctor and he refuses and smart-mouths me every time i bring it up, when i went to visit him I forced him to eat and he ate today saying that he would eat because it makes me happy... but later he told me he wouldn't eat tomorrow.\n\nI kept bugging him about it and when we finally got deep into talking about it I broke down crying and so did he (sincerely), but I know he's stubborn and may revert back to not eating.\n\nSo, despite him getting mad at me am I doing the right thing?

      "description": "Bit of a backstory and also apologies, I’m using a phone. \n\nI was living by myself and was planning to move to another 1 bedroom when my lease was up end of February. A friend who was also living by myself reached out and asked if we should become roommates since her lease was at the end of March, or so my friend thought. \n\nI have an unconditional jobs that would require me to spend only a couple of nights in my city in March, I said that yes we can move in together and I could put my stuff in storage for a month (currently only have a suitcase with some clothes in it)\nShe offered the storage in her apartment building said that I could spend those nights at her place. \n\nFirst week of March, we found a great 2 bedroom and applied for it. When we got approved that’s when she realized that her lease was up at the end of April, not March. I offered to wait until May, she said no and is now stuck paying 2 apartments. I paid the full amount of the deposit but we agreed that she still gets half since that’s what I was gonna pay her to use her storage and spend a couple of nights at her place. \n\nAnyway I have, for the last couple of days been bringing up the fact that I want to get movers to move my stuff as soon as possible. I asked if she wanted to move some of hers since I have a truck and movers coming (I specified that I was gonna pay for it since it’s my stuff but she was welcome to add some of her furniture) and she said she wasn’t ready but I was welcome to move my stuff. \n\nWhich leads me to today, I found some movers for tomorrow morning to come get my stuff. When I told her about my plans, she got upset, which lead to an argument. \n\nShe feels that I should’ve consulted with her first, that she would’ve wanted to wait a little more before moving some of her things since she doesn’t have any boxes ready yet (hasn’t bought any). That since I’m off until mid April, there was no hurry for me. She called me selfish and ungrateful. That tomorrow doesn’t work for her since she has a birthday party to plan for, in the evening. \nI said that I wasn’t comfortable in her living room and that I want to be settled and not have to live out of a suitcase since I am paying rent somewhere else. That I brought it up a couple of times before about wanting to move my things this weekend, that I may not work but have plans next week, just didn’t think I had to update her on them. \n\nI don’t know if it’s important but I should mention that since she has to pay for 2 apartments she is completely broke and asked me to cover half her rent at our new apartment because she would like to keep that other half for her birthday this weekend. \n\nSo Reddit, am I an asshole for not including her in my plans ?

      "description": "Long post so look out. Some background info:\n\nI am 13 years old and I live with my dad. My little sister (8) lives with my mum and on weekends we alternate between me going over there and her coming over here. My dad works on Sundays so when Emily (E) comes over here I have to look after her until mum comes to pick her up.\n\nOk now for the story.\n\nMum: M\n\nMe: Me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM comes to pick up E and E needs to use the bathroom. I want to show M a new soft toy I got which cost me $40 because it was big, the single softest/squishiest toy I have ever seen, and it was a character. (Ice bear from we bare bears.) We go into my bedroom and climb up the bunkbed to get it out, as it was at the back.\n\nM: You have a lot of stuffed animals don't you?\n\nMe: Yeah haha.\n\nI keep most of my soft animals on my bed including, but not limited to, Ice bear, Goldie a small dog that was given to me when my mum was pregnant and has come with me every time I leave the country, Freya a horse which I've had since I was one and my mum won it for me from a claw machine, a Hedwig, Harry Potter, a Glaceon, a Leafeon and an Eevee. I had others but those are the ones I can remember of the top of my head.\n\nM: You don't really need all of these do you?\n\nMe: No but I really like a lot of them.\n\nM: You should give them to E, she likes them and is the right age for them. You would have just thrown them out anyway.\n\nMe: No I wouldn't I love these toys, I really like them.\n\nM: You have to learn to let go, please give me the toys.\n\nShe starts to pick up some of the toys of the bed, including Ice Bear.\n\nMe: I just got Ice Bear and paid for him myself! You can't take him!\n\nM: I am your mother and can choose to take things as I please. Its called tough love.\n\nMe: Well can you give me the $40 I paid for him? That took me 2 months of saving!\n\nM: Thats ridiculous, I gave you $40 for your birthday last year!\n\nMe: Where do you think I got the money from for your birthday present!\n\nI had gotten mum a set of fancy candles for her birthday as I know she had her eye on them for a while but had just had to have the hot water fixed in the house and that was very expensive so budget was tight there.\n\nM: Well I don't choose what you spend your money on!\n\nAt that point E came out of the bathroom and started getting her stuff. I panicked.\n\nMe: Look how about this. I get them all in a bag and next time you come to pick E up I give them to you then.\n\nM: Fine but next time I'm taking them.\n\nBy this point E had her stuff and was ready to go so I said goodbye. Once they left I started to cry and decided to hide a lot of my toys until this blew over. Next time she came for them I said I had lost some of them trying to get them all ready. I still lost most of my toys to E though and I am very upset still as M wants me to keep looking for them.\n\nAITA for hiding them and not giving them to my sister?\n\nIs M even allowed to do that as I live with my dad?\n\nI welcome any advice.",

      "description": "There was recently a concert in my city. I wasn't going because I had to study for finals, but a good friend of mine wanted to go and I said she could sleep at my apartment for the weekend of the concert. (She lives about 2 hours away.)\n\nWe'd had this scheduled for about a month and 3 days before the concert, she asks if she can bring her roommate. My friend never talks about her roommate or ANYTHING and I didn't even know the roommate's name until my friend asked to bring her. All of a sudden my friend was GUSHING about how great her roommate was, how much time they spend together, etc. \n\nI'm a pretty private person (which my friend knows) so I said I didn't think I was comfortable with her inviting a girl I knew nothing about, especially when I had finals. I knew my friend would be quiet and let me study if I needed it but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of housing and feeding a total stranger. \n\nMy friend started begging me, saying she could NOT go to the concert alone and her roommate HAD to come with her. I told her I was uncomfortable and my suitemates (who are also private people but gave the OK for one guest) probably wouldn't welcome two extra noisy girls during finals week. \n\nMy friend went on to say \"You will be compensated...I'll bake muffins.\" I do not think muffins are enough compensation for giving a stranger breakfast, dinner, and a free room for three nights.\n\nI ended up saying a hard no to the roommate and my friend decided not to come to the concert at all if her roommate couldn't go with her. \n\nNow my friend isn't talking to me. I was annoyed by her asking to bring her roommate, but I don't think this is a good reason to toss three years of friendship down the drain. \n\nBut tell me, reddit. Should I apologize? Was I in the wrong?",

I know and am friends with most of the regulars in that particular Amino Community, including the subject of this post. However, just now, I saw a post from this guy (let's call him R; no reason, just a random letter). In it, he found a bunch of Shiny Goomy less than 30 Eggs from each other, whereas the Odds for the Method he was using were normally about 1/683. I jokingly commented, and I quote, \n\n\"Congrats, but I'm gonna need to confiscate that Masuda Method Luck. ;)\", to which he responds with: \n\n\"🤨....wow dude wow... I know you may be joking and all but that's actually pretty offensive dude. It's like saying, oh hey I want you to be terribly unlucky all the time and I want you to fail and suffer. Ugh, The one time I actually have good luck you do this to me....\n\nIf this is a joke, it's not the kind to be using it on peeps. It comes out as rude dude.\" \n\nI know this may not seem like a big deal, but I often struggle with scenarios like this, so I was wondering if I was actually being rude or he was simply being sensitive.

      "description": "To start, he[John(24M)] and his former girlfriend[Grace(24F)] both worked together. God knows how many times he’s cheated on and taken advantage of her blind love for him. \n\nThey have a co-worker[Julia(29F)] that John begins to fool around with behind Grace’s back. He does this knowing that Julia has been married for 10 years with three kids. Grace finds out and kicks John out of her apartment over month ago. \n\nEver since then, he asks to crash at my house at least every other day. He had every opportunity in the world to make things right with Grace(for the hundredth time), but chose not to because he felt that he could always use me and another mutual friend of ours to fall back on if things didn’t go his way. \nBut unfortunately for him, I have a tough time feeling any sympathy for others self inflicted wounds. \n\nNow clearly he was going through a tough time so I allowed him to crash in the living room a few nights a week, even though I have roommates. My patience eventually starts to run out. \nThis turns into him asking me to hang out or do certain things just so he can eventually ask to stay the night, because he knows I won’t say ‘no’ to him face-to-face. \n\nAlthough only one of them ever said it, I told John that my roommates don’t feel comfortable with him staying at our place anymore. \n\nThis does not stop him from continuing to ask every few days to crash while giving me several different sob stories as to why he has no where else to go. \n\nThe shitty thing is that if the roles were reversed, I’m confident he would have no trouble letting me stay with him as long as I needed to, so I feel obligated to help out. \n But the difference is, I would never put myself in that situation and I would never guilt trip him into anything.

      "description": "Last night at around midnight, my phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb, started blaring loud klaxon horns full-volume with a message about an Amber Alert. It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n ",

      "description": "Yesterday I met a nice woman on OKCupid, and things were going well.  We were getting to know one another, finding out what our common interest were.  We both like the mountains, watching horror movies and we both have our own struggles with depression.  She said she wanted to start out as friends and I thought \"cool, someone to hang out with and get to know.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe traded cell phone # and  took our conversation off of OKC and into texting.  I show her pictures of my two dogs and one cat, we talked a little bit more.  She wanted a full body picture of me, so I sent her a fully clothed full body picture of myself.  I'm still operating off the fact that we're just friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This is where things get muddy for me.  She asked if I wanted a full body naked picture of her and I told her that was up to her, whatever she was comfortable with.  So she sent me a naked picture of herself from behind and I did compliment her on her ass.  I assume at this point we were going into sexting mode.  (Yes, I know what they say happens when you assume) So we sexted for a bit and then she just stopped texting me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was last night and I haven't gotten a text from her since and I'm not really the one to just repeatedly text someone until I get a response.  If she doesn't want to talk anymore, that's fine.  I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for going from \"let's be friends\" to \"Hey nice ass,\" and sexting for a bit.  ",

And whenever I talk to my parents on the phone and topic that was discussed in the group chat comes up, my parents would chastise me for not checking the family chat enough and make me feel like a bad son for not doing so. Instead of answer the question I asked or continuing the conversation, the whole conversation will literally pause and focus on me not checking the family group chat enough.\n\nAnd every time this happens, I explain to them that I don't check the group chat often cause they mostly chat in Chinese and I can't read chinese. And my parents will counter \"well not all the time. We share photos and leave VMs too\" to which I reply \"well that doesn't change the fact you mostly converse in Chinese.\"\n\nWell today, I finally had enough. I got tired of them nagging/chastising me, and I went off at my parents. After I did, they sound so sad and disappointed. I know they're old (they're both retirement age). I know they live in a different country and our family group chat is one of the methods my parents used to feel close to me and my sister. I do try to participate periodically and occasionally share something from my life in it. AITA for 1. Not checking it as frequently as my parents wants me to and 2. Going off at my parents for their continuous chastising/nagging.",

It isn't easy for me to make calls or cancel shit, but I always force myself to. Maaaaybe not this time though.\n\n I've been looking for a job since I moved out (I've got college in the spring, new beginnings, all that jazz) but given that I have to take an uber until I can afford a car (and can't afford a car until I get a job), I've been looking for a job within walking distance.\n\nFinally get a call back. I excitedly accept the offer of an interview, hang up... And realize it's a forty minute drive each way. I don't know the area, so I didn't immediately realize. \n\nBeing indecisive, I neglected to call the lady back on Friday, thinking I could just figure it out on Saturday, when my interview was scheduled. Now I'm realizing I don't have the money to get there and back anyway, and it's twelve in the morning. Next course of action? Pretend I have a family emergency. I don't want to admit that I'm a broke ass to this young sounding, nice lady. I'll just.. Lie? Pretend my brother broke his arm again and I was his only ride, or something. Nothing too serious. I rehearsed it in my head and everything.\n\nSo I call. At twelve AM. Expect it to be a work number I could just drop a voicemail on and wiggle out of this. It's late, which makes my excuse more solid, right? But she fucking answers, sounding like I **woke her up**. Not the same peppy, awake lady from yesterday at all. Like, she has to clear her throat to even manage mumbling.\n\n\"Hello?\" She says groggily. \n\nAnd I don't say anything. Pretty sure my balls went internal. \n\n\"Um.. Hello??\"\n\nPanic. I hang up. Immediately get ready to lie about a butt dial in the emergency room where my brother broke his arm and I was his only ride. \n\nBut now I'm thinking I just.. won't go. I don't want to call tomorrow morning because I fucking called her in the middle of the night now. \n\nAm I the asshole for taking my humiliation in silence and just completely bolting?",

      "description": "I  have known my co-worker for about 5 years - only worked with him for the past 2.  We were acquaintances before working together, but have become friends -  we play golf, my fiance and I hang out with him and his wife from time to time, etc.\n\nAnyway,  we are opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to politics/religion.  I am a non-religious theist and  typically support the democrats, not because I bleed blue, but because I think the Republican agenda is backwards.  My friend, lets call him Greg, is a conservative Christian.  We disagree and we talk about it.  Generally, we do a good  job of looking to understand where the other is coming from, but we can also always find the spot that really sets the other person off.  We  have agreed to \"not go there\" while at work as these conversations make others uncomfortable and are  not appropriate / conducive to getting work done, but we still do it via G-chat.\n\nToday, (slightly hungover) I opened our G-chat and noticed that  yesterday we had been talking about biblical literalism.  I had asked him if he believed that the story of Jonah and the whale was factual  also threw out Methusela.  Greg responded, \"yea\".  Seeing this conversation from the previous day, I started in, \"do you believe that the sun is the center of the solar system or do you have a geocentric view of the solar system?\".  Greg responded, \"If  these are in fact honest questions I really don't mind and will gladly go through them all with  you, but if this is just going to be a googling  \"contradictions in the  bible\" session to try and trip me up, with all due respect I'm not real interested in that\".\n\nThis  hit me kinda hard.  I felt like an asshole - caught red-handed.  I had definitely looked for parts of the bible that were most out of line with our scientific observations.  I have held these beliefs for years and knew that these conflicts between scripture and science  existed, but was using the internet to find them and be able to cite  specific instances.\n\nI continued on for a bit trying to get him to take a side on scripture  vs. science with no success.  In the end, I apologized for the line of  questioning and plan to redirect the conversation to \"what led you to  believe that the bible is a factual document?\" as then I am getting out  of proving right / wrong and back to looking to understand.\n\nIt  would probably be for the best if Greg and I would just abandon these  conversations altogether, but it seems to be what we always circle back  to.  I know that we both enjoy talking about these things, but  inevitably, once every couple of weeks, especially when a big political  event comes along one of us says something and feels the need to  apologize.  Today it was me.\n\nAm I the Asshole for pushing a friend who is a known conservative Christian on his beliefs as a biblical literalist?",

      "description": "TLDR At the bottom\n\nThere are a few pieces of background here. \n\nMy wife is 2nd generation chinese and there is a cultural expectation on her side to serve the elders first. \n\nSecond, she asked me to post this on her behalf. \n\nI'm 33m and don't speak the dialect in which the argument was spoken. The version of events below was more or less as provided to me from my wife (not on reddit)\n\nLastly, this was during our 3yo daughter's birthday party with about 7 families.\n\nThe party was going well and there are a mix of families with about 12 kids and their parents. This was held at a McDonald's so they do take the main orders and we provided a pretty unicorn cake. All is good until it's time to cut the cake and there are 3year olds lining up to get at the cake. \n\nTo prevent tantrums and hands in the cake we serve the closest people first. Anyway, grandma gets served 3rd last, and passes the cake off to her son. Wife gets another piece for her and grandma refuses the cake and is visibly upset.\n\n wife asks what's wrong. (All in their dialect, but with angry tones so it's clear they're arguing)\n\nGrandma says she should have been offered cake first before the kids, pregnant wives, and my side (who all happened to be closer).\n\nWife calls her out in chinese, \"are you serious??? You couldn't wait to bring this up after the party? So you're throwing a fit at a 3year olds party?\" To which the response is she should have been served first and how dare you (my wife) scold me (grandma), i didn't come here for you to scold me.\n\nWife replies that it was an honest mistake and that she will try to remember next time.\n\nGrandma replies, \"there wont be a next time, because you'll serve me first\"\n\nIssue currently unresolved as they left shortly after, should be noted she's pulled other small BS in the past. I.e. being angry at   being greeted, \"hey\" instead of \"hello\". \n\nMy vote: NTA and pretty straight forward that you can't please everyone and that keeping toddlers happy is more important than wife's mom. Would like to know perspectives from culturea with the same cultural expectations about serving elders first.\n\nTLDR: Wife's mom calls out wife in another language about being served close to last. Wife says she is ridiculous for throwing a fit at a 3yo's party.",

      "description": "I have been in a messy relationship (lots of on and off) until a few weeks ago, and have an internal conflict about whether or not I am completely to blame for everything going wrong. It is important to note that my ex had significant trust issues with me.\n\nEffectively, me and my girlfriend (lets call her Amy) had been together for around 18 months before breaking up. We eventually got back together about 3 months later. Anywho, in the 3 month gap, when I was single, I slept with someone other than her (call her Brooke) whom she absolutely hated. Amy had previously told me that she hated Brooke and anyone associated with her (however we play at the same sports club so I couldn't really avoid seeing her at all times). A month or so later, Amy and I rekindled.\n\nWhen we got back together, she asked me if I had slept with anyone else. I disclosed all of the people I had been with except for Brooke, because I thought that telling Amy about Brooke would crush her and any chances we had of making it long term. I thought it best to wait a little while to tell her, when we were back on really solid ground. When I did tell her, shit hit the fan, and effectively she broke up with me for breaching her trust.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? On the one hand I think my intentions in lying to Amy were pure, but on the other hand I should have recognised our trust issues, swallowed my pride and disclosed (potentially risking the relationship).

      "description": "I worked and played league at a very family friendly bowling alley.  I was quickly given a lot of trust and responsibilities and was told they were hoping to make me the new night manager.  I had never worked in this industry before and had just started bowling there shortly before.  My husband and I spent a significant amount there as customers, far more than my pay.  I was told to keep it a family friendly and safe environment and to ask people to leave if necessary.\n\nMy coworkers and I all got along very well.  I didn’t like the man working behind the bar as he got into it with employees and customers often.  I ran the social media for the alley and had to deal with complaints about him often.  When I would speak to the head manager about it, he told me this guy was an old friend of the owner’s and a bowling whiz and that he will never be gone and we all just have to deal with him.  Okay, I kept my distance.\n\nTwo nights a week a DJ would come in. With him would come a woman who never bowled and never spent a dime.  I noticed she sometimes had drinks in hand.  She was usually dressed pretty inappropriately and would hang all over the DJ.  As time progressed she came more and more often and got more inappropriate and so did his comments over the microphone about her.  However they were not a couple.  One of my male coworkers was her target and he was so sick of her inappropriate behaviors and attentions.  She also had a bad habit of going up to league bowlers and chatting, which is usually a no go depending on the seriousness of the player.  I decided to keep an eye on her.  My boss asked for my opinion on the atmosphere of the alley and our spending and I mentioned this woman and the DJ.  He cost a fortune and the patrons rarely requested songs or acknowledged him and he took up valuable floor space as well.  I mentioned a few complaints I’d received about the woman. My boss seemed interested in what I had to say and said he knew the woman I was referring to and that she’d been a problem for a long time.  \n\nFast forward a bit- my husband came up to bowl on my shift one night and he saw the woman and says to me “OMG I know her, I slept with her once years ago.  I didn’t call her back because I had a terrible time.  She was pissed.”  \n\nThe woman saw us together and saw me kiss him and after that, she made my life a living hell.  She told all of my coworkers that she had fucked my Husband.  She told them personal things about him and suddenly my workplace became like high school.  Pointing, whispering and laughing, her flipping me off while I worked, etc.  \n\nOne night she approached my husband and some other serious league players and tried to chat with them during their quiet practice.  She started out only addressing my husband but he wouldn’t respond and she wouldn’t leave so she started talking to the others.  This same night she had been especially obnoxious in my direction and had been making my job miserable all night.  I found out she was sleeping with one of my married coworkers and that one of the league wives was also sleeping with him and a fist fight and tears and an altercation had occurred on the premises.  This was all too much and I asked her to leave and not come back.  She laughed at me and went to the guy behind the bar, who told me I was about to lose my job over this.\n\nIt turns out she has practically lived at this bowling alley for ten plus years.  I don’t know why she had been MIA for my initial time there.  She is sleeping with the guy behind the bar and gets a lot of free drinks.  She doesn’t spend money there.  A lot of people who had complained about her to me turned out to be really close to her- because they felt their jobs were on the line if they weren’t.  \n\nI was removed from my position and moved to a job working in the office- not actually in the bowling alley.  The man behind the bar had demanded my firing and they said no but reached this compromise.  She would still be allowed to be at the alley any time. \n\nThe next league night, my husband and I were both blackballed.  I was accused of not using courtesy, not knowing the rules, bringing down the league and using the bathroom at inopportune times.  We were heckled by the guy behind the bar and his teammates.  I was in tears and my husband was furious.  I ended up leaving the job and the league.  \n\nI pulled out receipts of my spending at the alley and showed my boss the financial errors of allowing a non paying visitor who bothers many people to take precedence over me.  He said his hands were tied, she was a long time staple there and that he apologized for giving me too much power too soon.  \n\nI’m so salty about this because there’s nowhere else as cheap or as close to bowl and because now my relationship with my ex coworkers, who were good friends, is nonexistent because they chose their livelihoods (and rightly so).  \n\nMost of the people who know this story think everyone else is the asshole, but some think IATA for trying to kick her out.  Some say I should have just ignored her and that it was because she’d slept with my husband.  I tell them if I had to avoid places because someone there slept with my husband, I couldn’t go anywhere because he was a total ho.  (It’s true, we see one night stands or exes of his everywhere, it isn’t great but it is what it is and we are all adults about it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We haven't moved in yet, and my wife already has two of her friends ask her if they can register their address at our house.\nThe reason being is they want their kids to be in that school district as well.\n\nAt first, I felt uncomfortable but didn't say much. Started researching the practice. It is clear that the practice is common, and not cracked down on much in Toronto. \nBut then I find out one of the friends has filed for bankruptcy and is going through a very nasty divorce. My Spidey senses are firing on all cylinders now. So, I make it clear to my wife that I won't be an active or passive participant in fraud or take the risk of her personal situation somehow biting us in the ass.\n\nMy wife didn't like that answer, is making me feel like shit for not helping out her friends when they need help. Also, I've been getting multiple text messages from our friends telling me not to be an asshole and to think of the future of the kids - how I'm blocking them from getting a good education by not letting them put our house as their address.\n\nI don't know anymore.

      "description": "TL:DR My Cousin and I used to be close when we were really younger (&gt;10), but as we grew up, we became distant. I’ve tried to re-build this relationship growing up, but feel that the effort was never returned. She is having a child this summer and her baby shower is this week. I don’t want to go and my family is making me feel like the asshole for not going, especially since it’s the first child of the next generation in our family. AITA?\n\n\nIn my teens, I actively made an effort to support her. I went to her high school graduation despite being younger and just learning to drive (her school was an hour from where I lived). My immediate family didn’t even go. My aunt (her mom) and our grandma invite me over for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year. I’ve gone and tried to make conversation with my cousin, but she just gives me one word answers. When it came time for me to graduate, no one from her side came. \n\n\nShe got married two years ago. She was engaged after 2 weeks and married 2 weeks after that. I never met her now husband but still went to support her. I don’t mind how little she waited to get married as her husband was going to basic training. It was just really inconvenient not just for me, but for some of the other guests, to schedule for a wedding so last minute. My cousin didn’t particularly seem grateful or interactive with guests. I went and it was really awkward for me because I didn’t know anyone except for my Aunt and grandma. They weren’t around much because they were trying to hold the wedding together. \n\n\nAfter the wedding, her husband was deployed across the world. She moved with him. That Thanksgiving, my aunt and grandma told me that my cousin was pregnant. \n\n\nEarlier this month, they invited people to her baby shower. Which they are doing an hour from where I live via skype. The registry is on Amazon and there is a huge shipping costs with everything purchased. I’ve been contemplating going, but looking back, I feel my cousin has never made an effort to have a relationship with me. I don’t want to waste any more time or money on her. On the other hand, it’s the first kid in the next generation. My family is making me feel like an asshole for not going, even though I’ve brought up all the previous events. AITA?\n",

      "description": "So, a few months ago I started with Poledance and decided to buy my own pole. But since there's not really a lot of room in my apartment, I asked my friend who owns a building, to rent a room there in order to practice on my pole. I'm completly fine with paying rent for that of course.\n\nThe only thing is, I didn't get my \"own\" room, but he made me set up the pole in one of the rooms he uses for parties. I was initially fine with that because I'm not practicing on the weekends anyways.\n\nBut here's what I struggle with. He uses the pole for his parties. Which, I don't really have a problem with, but I don't really see why I would have to pay rent for putting the pole in there, when he uses it for his parties without paying me to use it or anything. (or even asking for that matter) I mean, I provide a 400+ $ Pole for his parties.\n\nI talked to him about it and my concerns regarding the pole (it was pretty expensive and I don't want to get it damaged) and me not being okay with him using it when I'm paying rent to put it there. But he just told me to suck it up and that he can't stop anyone from using it during the parties because he's not around all the time etc.\n\nBut the thing is, he is actively encouraging people to use it, posting it on his facebook page that *he's* got a pole for the party room now and all sorts of stuff.\n\nI told him to either stop encouraging people to use the pole or stop making me pay rent to put it there, but he just got angry with me, telling me I just want to be a cheap bitch and not pay rent etc...\n\nLong story short: My Friend wants to use my property which I put up in a room I rented from him  and gets angry when I tell him not to.",

      "description": "Throwaway just because i’d like my privacy. A slightly long story, sorry.\n\nMy stepfather, who’s actually been in my life for longer than my biological father, is a great man. He’s well-liked, smart, he’s kind and i can see that he makes my mom incredibly happy. I never used to have problems with him — we’d do regular father-daughter activities as if we were related by blood, and I think of my stepbrother as a real brother. The point is that i love him just as if he was my real father. \n\nBut sometimes he has outbursts i don’t understand. My mother often works late into the night, and when she’s not here, my stepfather tends to get weirdly angry. He’d chastise me for every single thing i do wrong, he’d slam doors, yell at me and my stepbrother. When he’s particularly angry he throws things and call me worthless. I don’t usually take things like that to heart, but it’s different when a man you’ve trusted for most of your life does it. The breaking point was sometime early last year, where some of his actions went out of control and caused me to have a severe panic attack.\n\nI think he was remorseful after that incident, because ever since then he’s rarely gone out of control. He seems calmer, and his outbursts are rare now. He also acts more cautious around me, as if he’s afraid of hurting me. He’s also gone out of his way to, idk, care about me more. He’s started to pick me up from school and bring home food from work he knows i like. Which is a refreshing change, and i appreciate that he’s being so nice, but i have to admit that ever since that incident i never acted the same way around him. I was cold and distant, despite his efforts to reach out to me. I’d ignore his calls and texts, rarely make an effort to speak to him, and when we did interact i always was short with him and a lot ruder than i had to be. I was openly warm and caring to my mother and stepbrother, while i barely spared him a glance. I guess I didn’t realize i was doing this until just recently my mother pulled me aside, and asked why i was being so cold to him. I promised her i would be nicer, but even after i’m aware of my actions, i just act like i used to around him. I know it’s hurting him that i won’t look him in the eye, but it’s almost impossible for me to bring myself to do it.\n\nAITA for not being willing to reconcile with my stepfather, despite his efforts to mend our relationship?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "     Okay, so my grandmother died in September, and this has been bugging me since. My grandmother was my main supporter, both emotionally and financially through out my entire academic career. If not for her, I wouldn’t have had a cosigner for my student loans, and I wouldn’t be able to afford school (my mom pulled out Parent Plus loans, and my grandmother had to cosign). My grandmother was my main confidante, and was proud that I am the first in college and always supported me while I was in school.\n     In July, she got sick and had to stay in the hospital for extended amounts out time. I was in summer school, so while my mom was going everyday, I would have to miss days when my class got out late. I would come around 4 times a week. \n     As fall approached, my grandmother was getting sicker, but all the while was extremely concerned about my grades and school (as usual). She wouldn’t talk or eat, and it became very difficult for us to talk about her favorite things like we used too because she was depressed. The only thing that would catch her attention was if I told her I got a good grade on a test, and when I told her I got all A’s for the first time since Ive been in college. \n     My mother was going everyday after work. She worked 200 miles away, and we both lived 60 miles away from the hospital. She was my grandmother’s main supporter during my grandmother’s last months, and it was taking a big toll on her. \n     Early August came, and I still had no idea how I was going to pay for school. My grandmother always helped me handle things, and I had pushed back things because I didn’t want her thinking about finances while in the hospital. In late August, she was more so alert, but more depressed, and I took a chance and brought it up, and she was cool with it. My mom was there, and she looked upset. \n     I fill out the loan information, I submit it, and its denied. I’m absolutely freaking out. While Im visiting my grandmother in the hospital, Sallie Mae calls me and is talking to me about some loan information, so I leave the room and walk to the lobby to talk to them. The guy on the phone is like, “oh it’s okay, just try with someone else, or try the same cosigner after they get their credit up a little bit” and it just sets me of. I start crying. By the time the consversation with the Sallie Mae guy is over, my mom is ready to leave. \n     We get in the car, and have the most toxic interaction I’ve ever had in my life. By the time the hour drive home is almost done, she’s screaming and saying “you’re selfish”, “you only care about Nan because of your student loans”, “you’re the devil and you should be ashamed of yourself”. This has been on my mind for months, and it really has me wondering if they’re true. Me and my grandmother always made school a priority, but did I make it too much of a priority while she was dying?

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm seeing my ex-wife after 8 months of separation following a very clean, very civil divorce. Things are better than ever and we question our decision to divorce every day. We had been seeing each other off and on throughout the entire separation, going back and forth between wanting to make it work and wanting to move on. At one point during our moving on stage, her and my best friend hooked up. This is the guy I entrusted her with while I was deployed, as she's a bit of a social hermit, and I knew she'd need someone to keep her company (I know, I know, the irony). To my knowledge, I believe the two of them never fooled around during my absence. We divorced about 6 months after I returned home, and 6 months later they slept together.\n\nNow, I understand that this was her attempt to move on, and I'm not mad at her about that. I slept with other people during this stage as well. What I'm upset about is that my friend was okay with this. I hesitate to call it \"bro code,\" as I feel that cheapens the concept, but I feel like there is a code of ethics amongst friends. An agreement to respect sensitive situations like this. He doesn't know that I know, and I haven't spoken to him since. I feel like 6 months is way too soon for a friend to get involved like that. I feel like he should have contacted me somehow, to let me know what was occurring, not for my permission, because they're grown adults and can do what they want, but to at least respect our friendship. To my understanding, he refuses to talk about it with her. When it was happening, she tried to talk to him about me and he wanted no part of that conversation, which leads me to believe he feels it was wrong as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to make amends with him, but I can't help but feel angry at him for sweeping this under the rug, so to speak. I'm waiting, hoping that he contacts me so we can air it out. I'm hesitant to contact him myself because if I do, I feel like I'd ambush him with my knowledge of their \"meeting\" and force him to talk to me about it, rather than give him the opportunity to do so himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling betrayed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Divorced after two years, ex and I were seeing each other off and on. About 6 months after the divorce, a very close friend ended up sleeping with her. He doesn't know I know, she was honest, her and I are working it out, as we're together again and plan on remarrying. Don't want to call it \"bro code\" but I feel like a code of ethics has been crossed by my friend and I feel betrayed. AITA?",

He would ask what I'm doing in the bathroom with the door closed, and I always answer by saying something like \"BITCH! I'M TRYING TO TAKE A SHIT! LET ME BLAST ASS IN PEACE!\". It happened quite often, and he would tell me to open the door and tell me that it's okay to let him see me be vulnerable. What he said would have been so cute if he weren't talking about my bowel movement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never wanted him to feel like I wasn't comfortable with him, cause I was.

X would sometimes stay up late just to play with her (cause time zones). i played with them sometimes, Y was a very fun girl to be with, it was easy to get along with her.\n\none day in school, X told me he liked her and she was his first love. i wasn't really surprised, he talked about her like she was the only good thing in his life. but around march 2018 Y was gone. she unfriended and blocked him and all of their mutual friends on basically all platforms.\n\nX was devastated, of course i was upset but i didn't feel the grief to his level (me and Y were not that close) 2017 was a very rough year for X and i know that, he would sometimes say that Y was the reason why he didn't give up that time, he's tried many times to get into contact with her, but nothing. i've also tried to and it was to no avail.  \n\n\nit's 2019, X is still upset and has never been the same. last night, we were calling on discord and he once again mentioned Y. i kinda got frustrated and snapped, i told him it's already been a year and he should \"move on cause i'm sure she already did.\" he stayed quiet and just ended the call.\n\ni feel really guilty for saying that but i knew he had to move on.. if am an a-hole, please tell me how i can help him, thanks  \n\n\n  \nthis is my first reddit post, i've been watching a bunch of reddit youtubers (fresh, comment awards, etc)  for awhile. apologies if this doesn't seem so reddit-y",

Recently a vacancy has come about due to an internal promotion and we have both discussed interest in the position.  The position is more in her side of the business than mine, however I had interviewed for it 6 years ago when it was last open (and started my career in that side of the business).  The position would put one of us in a position of middle management, however upper management is fully aware of the relationship and have indicated that it would not represent a conflict in either scenario (we both checked with our senior manager).\n\nWe have discussed the possibility of both applying for it and talked about what that would entail, including the power/authority differential inherent to being a part of the management team.  There was no sentiment of not wanting her to go after it, and I felt like there was nothing wrong with me going after it.  I felt like I was being very encouraging of her to go for the position too because she has a lot of great assets and would be a great fit for the position.  We left our discussion on the subject Sunday evening.  I spoke with my immediate supervisor on Monday and was encouraged to apply.  I submitted my application and immediately told my partner that I had done the thing... to which she became standoffish and distant and we didn't talk until later Monday evening.  \n\nWhile talking about it my partner expressed that she is upset that I made a potentially life/relationship changing decision without giving her a heads up regarding making the decision.  She also expressed frustration that I could potentially be placed in a position to tell her how to conduct her job.  Additionally, she indicated that she feels like I don't value the relationship as I haven't put it first in this situation.  My issue is that while talking about everything on Sunday, she didn't mention any of these concerns.  I was left speechless.  I apologized for making her feel like she wasn't a priority and explained my view that I feel a promotion for either of us would be awesome.  She indicated that now she doesn't think she will even apply for the position and then indicated that she didn't even think she would initially as she doesn't want to be a part of the management team.  I'm still trying to be encouraging as I want to see her grow as a person and love seeing her succeed and honestly feel like if she applied she would be the obvious choice.  \n\nShe has also expressed that I should, \"Do what I want, as she doesn't want to be a part of my career decision making process.\"  She is still barely talking and I'm trying to give her space to process and explore her feelings (my natural style is to resolve these issues immediately which in the past has only caused greater turmoil).  My thought in applying is that I've been trying to work my way up for years, I had a conversation with her where she didn't express any concerns, my supervisor encouraged me to apply and at the end of the day a promotion would have a big financial impact if either of us got it.  I feel that I have been very supportive and continue to encourage her to apply as well... with a view that we would both be doing this for us.  \n\n\n\nSo... let's have your judgment.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR:  Partner and I talked about a job possibility that we were both interested in, I applied and told her I applied, she's mad at me now as she feels that I'm not putting our relationship first.  Am I the asshole?\n\n  ",

I still wanted to stay together but she didn’t and that was that. \n\nWe met up for coffee and it was actually a lot of fun. Durning she told me she was flying across the country to Georgia to meet ‘a friend’. I asked and she said it was a friend she met while we were together. Well now we are broken up and she’s going to see him which, even though I don’t like it, is fine because we are not together.  \n\nWhat bothers me is that I can’t help but feel this guy has a big part to play in why we broke up. Timing just fits too well and when we broke up she made me feel like I was the sole reason. If some guy came into her life and she wanted to put more into that than her relationship then I’m a little pissed of. \n\nWhat does the internet think?",

      "description": "First of all, sorry about formatting, I´m on mobile and English is not my first language. I also need to say that this will be long and full of family drama, but I know this sub has a pretty neutral enviroment to find answers, so here goes nothing.\n\n\nTo give you a little bit of context I´m a 22yo female, my cousin is a 40yo female too, I´ll call her L. My family is catholic and my mom comes from a large family (youngest of 7 siblings), but me and my problematic cousin are both single childs. Christmas has always been an important holiday. In Spain we usually reunite 5 days in total (Dec 24th, Dec 25th, Dec 31st, Jan 1st and Jan 6th) so it is a big thing. \n\n\nLast december we lost my aunt (L´s mother) to an agressive colon cancer and since then, everything has got worse. She is still living with her dad, my family has enabled her shitty attitude her entire life because she had “a difficult childhood” (she didn´t, she was raised by my mother until she was 13 because both her parents worked a lot, they made a shit tone of money, she had every single toy she wanted and all love and attention for being the little girl of the house. When she was a preteen his dad had an affair and as a result of that, he had another daughter… but my aunt decided to forgive him. That was her “difficult childhood”).\n\nShe has been this selfish, self absorved, manipulative, abusive piece of shit since I remember and that is why most of our family avoid her at all costs, she has to be the center of attention or there´ll be drama. Sadly, one of her enablers is my own mother and I don't even know what to do to open her eyes.\n\nSome of her top tantrums are:\n\n\n1. She is my godmother. When I was around 5 or 6 she came to my house screaming, I was a child so I didn´t know what was all of that about. She hit my mother and told her that I, a little kid, was a piece of shit and that I was dead for her. My mom had to threw her out of the house.\n\nMy mother´s response nowadays? “Oh come on thegoldennana, she was on medication, it was so hard for her, she didn´t mean it, you knows she loves you very much. I bet you would do the same”. For the context, her doctors said L was bipolar, but my family never accepted the diagnosis and changed the psiquiatrist. Now the enablers of my family say that she acted that way because of the medication.\n\n\n2. She was violent and abusive towards her own mother, and towards her dad to this day. I remember her hitting my aunt in my own kitchen because she needed more money. One of my aunts (who hates her) told me some months ago that she stabed her own mother with a fork on the hand, my poor aunt was so embarassed to go to the ER because she didn´t want to press charges, I just want to cry about it because no one helped her because it was her “child”, a fucking grown woman.\n\nI tell my mother that if my uncle was the one that hurt my poor aunt she would have called the police and would be making his life miserable, but since it was her beloved \"child\" she was enabling her. I feel disgusted about this, the hipocrisy kills me.\n\n\n3. My poor aunt (L's mother) had breast cancer four years ago, luckily she survived. After all the chemo, L told her (during one of her MULTIPLE tantrums) that she deserved the illness and that it was such a shame that she didn´t die.\n\n\n4. She has a cat. Poor cat has no toys because she doesn´t want to clean after he plays and she says she doesn-t have time to play with him, even though she doesn´t work because no job is good enough for her. My mother makes him homemade toys and beds and her father is the one that feeds hims and the one that cleans his box. One day one of her friends got her a puppy and the cat didn´t like it one bit. Nowadays the dog is ours, she left him here saying she would be back “tomorrow” but never came for him. Doggy is okay tho, he´ll be five next March.\n\n\n5. The last string for me was summer 2017. We were at my house and I was having dinner alone because it was late.  L and her mother were in the kitchen finishing a coffee and my mom wanted to go to sleep because she was tired, so she told them to please leave. She lost her shit. She went to the bathroom and came back yelling her mother that we didn´t want them there and that they should leave and never come back because we were rude pieces of shit. My mom, the enabler, told her “L honey, I didn´t meant it that way, I´m just tired, my head is hurting and I need to sleep” and she grabbed her arm to try to calm her down, L pushed her and told her  “don´t touch me or I´m gonna rip your fucking head off”. I don´t even know what entered my body, I was shaking, I felt the rage through my veins… I went to the kitchen like I was on drugs and told her to don´t speak to my mother like that ever again because I would kill her. (I know it sounds cringy right now so sorry about that, but I saw red, I felt the need to defend my mother) She said “oh look at this badass over here” so I told her that she was a good for nothing 40yo piece of shit. She grasped and stormed through the door. Her mother was another enabler so she told me “hey thegoldennana, that was unnecessary, she isn´t 40 yet” and stormed behind her.\n\nYou wanna know what my mom did? She got mad at me for yelling at her, she told me that she had “everything under control” and that it was my fault things escalated… I wanted to cry. A couple of my aunts came home right after the incident because one of them lives on the 5th floor and we live in the 8th floor. They were having coffee too and heard the yelling. They reassured me and told my mother that she was in the wrong, but it didn´t matter. L NEVER said she was sorry, because she thinks everything she does is fine.\n\n\n6. As I said before, my aunt died last December. She went to the ER on the 21st of september and never got out until they sent her home to die peacefully. My mother slept with her every single day until she died because her own daughter couldn´t be bodered to be by her side. She just wanted the car to spend money and go out with friends, so she visited her mom 5 minutes every other day. \n\nWhen they sent her home to die, all she wanted to drink was some kind of gas water that comes out of a natural fountain in a town 30 minuts drive from where we live. My aunt (the one who is not an enabler) gave her 50 euros and told her to please get gas and go a get the water for her mother. Hours went past and she didn´t go, her excuse? “oh I´m sorry, but I have to look after the economy of this family”. My aunt was so enraged she would have killed her in that moment. That water was the only thing her dying mother wanted to drink and she denied her that because she was a lazy piece of shit. Thankfully my uncle got her the water that night.\n\nDays after, I was there, holding my aunt´s hand when she passed away. Her daughter was in the kitchen making the act of her life with a couple of friends.\n\nA couple of days after was her funeral. When everything was done, the whole family decided to have lunch somewhere because it was late to start cooking. She threw a tantrum because she wanted to go to Lola´s (not the actual name of the restaurant). Not a single one of us could believe what she was asking for, that was the restaurant where we would go to celebrate things with my deceased aunt, I only have memories of that place with her and I can´t put a foot there almost a year later because I would sob uncontrolably. She got mad until one of my aunts (another enabler) went to Lola´s with her and her friends, and by the way, my aunt had to pay for everyones lunch.\n\n\n7. Last Christmas were pure chaos, my mom told me to please go with them to my uncle´s house, because that was what my deceased aunt would have wanted, so silly me, I went. \n\nWe got there about 8 pm to make dinner (this was on Dec 24th) and after telling me that my make up was hideous (if she isn´t the one doing your make up, then your make up is shit) it went downhill pretty fast. Everyone was doing something, we were helping each other with everything, except L of course. She was whining about being hungry and cold so we told her to help with something so she wouldn´t be that cold, but hes answer was “nah, I´m good, I don´t want to do anything“ so she kept on whining, making everyone late with her shitty facebook videos and making her father miserable telling him that he was a piece of shit for having a beer with a couple of friends (hipocrisy 100, because she was hungover) and talking shit about him having another daughter. Things got worst while we were having dinner. She likes to make childish and vulgar sexual jokes about everyone, so she said to my parents “hey uncle, i´m sure you love to lick your wife´s clam every night” out of fucking nowhere, because there was a gastronomic program about clams on the TV. I told her to shut up, that we were eating and that I didn´té have to think about what my parents did in private. She got pissed and told me that I should take a joke, so I told her that she wouldn´t like it if I said that about her parents and she said that it was not the same because her mom was dead, so she got mad again when I told her that every single person on that table was grieving the death of her mother and not only her. I went to my inlaws´s with my bf the rest of the holidays.\n\n\n8. This summer karma got her, she broke her wrist. She had surgery but didn´t follow through with the exercises her doctor told her to do so she has to have surgery again. This is the perfect excuse for her to not getting a job. Now her plan is asking for government money. She already has a pay because of “fibromyalgia”, she chose that one because they don't know what causes it, so no one can prove she doesn´t have it. Are you getting what type of person she is?\n\n\n\n9. A couple of weeks ago she was talking on the phone with my mom and t",

      "description": "tl;dr at the bottom\n\nI’ve only been friends with this girl for ~1.5 years. We were super close a year ago when it was us two plus two other girls, so the 4 of us would hang out a lot. I think I was able to handle her because there were two other friends always present so I didn’t have to deal with her alone. Ever since the two other friends have left, I’ve started seeing how this girl really is and it’s pretty annoying. \n\nBasically, the problem is that she’s super self-absorbed. She only does stuff that would advance HER interests, HER career, etc. She thinks everything is always about her. She constantly put down my likes. She explicitly fakes interest in things if they will advantage her in some way. She likes things her way or no way. She’s super unwilling to compromise in any situation. She’s always ready to shut me down, and does so by telling me to either “shut up” or “shush” if I ever point out something she opposes or was unaware of. So. Freaking. Annoying. I guess all of this is good for her to advance HER goals and stuff, but it’s not good for her if she ever aims to attain/maintain relationships with people lol. \n\nIt makes sense then that she has no friends other than me, and she’ll talk to people she’s met through me. She complains all the time about having a RBF and blames it for her lack of friendships, but I highly doubt the way you look can ward off people to that extent. And I don’t even think she has a RBF. But anyway, she doesn’t make any effort to make new friends either. Solely complains. \n\nRecently, I’ve started to distance myself from her because of how toxic and annoying she is. She’s not dumb so I’m pretty sure she’s gotten the hint, but I do kind of feel bad that she’ll have no friends left. AITA for leaving her like this? Also, should I confront her about this? I have opted not to because we have a lot of classes together in the future and it’ll be awkward. \n\ntl;dr: a friend is super self-absorbed and hence has no friends other than me. I’ve had enough of her toxic traits and started distancing myself from her, AITA for leaving her all alone?",

      "description": "So I've been the proud owner of a Switch for a couple months now, and I bought Smash as soon as it came out. Before that I picked up Breath of the Wild and played that for a month or two. But a little after Smash came out, one of my roommates got really into it and asked me if he could use the Switch to play. I didn't mind at all and was happy to let him use it. Now this is probably my fuck-up, but when I loan something to someone, I assume they'll do what I would do, and treat it with the utmost care possible. Anyway, that takes us to now- since I use a gamecube controller to play Smash, I've been using that and that only to play since the game came out. My roommate has been using the joycons, both when we play as a household and a fair amount on his own with the Switch out of the dock. So last night I grabbed the Switch to play in bed for a little while, and I noticed a grating creaking and lack of response with the trigger on the right joycon. This wasn't present the last time I used it a while ago, and it affects how the controller functions. I haven't actually confronted him about this yet, but I feel that because I was loaning something of mine with no strings attached that he should be responsible for repair/replacement of the Joycon, since by most estimations it was probably his use of the system that led to the creaking issue. Am I the asshole for assuming sharing something of my own comes with the implicit agreement of treating it better than something you own, and being responsible if something on it breaks/goes defective?\n\n**Tl;dr:** Roommate borrows my Switch to play smash. $70 controller starts to squeak because of said Smashing. AITA for wanting him to be responsible for fixing or replacing said controller?",

      "description": "Throughout the semester, my friend and I have been in a finance class together. I come to class, take notes, make my own study guides for quizzes, and always try to understand the material the best I can. At the beginning of the semester, I helped my friend by doing small things like sending him my study guide if he claimed to have a lot of assignments and grabbing the problem sets that we can only get in class for him if he couldn't come. As the semester has gone on, though, he's stopped paying attention in class entirely. When he does show up, he's usually working on homework for different classes and not paying attention at all. The last straw for me was him trying to put his name on my extra credit assignment (we could work in groups and I tried to work with him, he just didn't respond to me about it until the day it was due) without actually helping. I've just become less willing to help him because it feels like he's taking advantage of my effort at this point. So AITA for not wanting to help him anymore??",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nSo some background: my sister wet the bed up until she was about six. She then constantly wet herself because while doing anything she refused to take bathroom breaks. It got to the point of my mom having to take the controller away because she would sit for hours and wet herself not wanting to take a two minute break. We have half the basement to ourselves (we share a half, the other half is storage). Our beds are about 4 feet apart and there is pretty much zero privacy. Also, we are at our moms house for the week and my dad's on the weekend's.\n\n\nShe is 11 now. For the past 1½-2 years she has reeked of urine. And by reeked I mean reeked. Standing two feet away you could smell it. All her clean clothes, her bed, and all her stuffed animals all smell like urine. It's so bad that sometimes when she sits on the couch I have to spray it with fabreez after because it's so bad. \n\nI have let my dad know multiple times and every time I get the same response: \"okay, I'll talk to her when I see her\" and nothing has changed. \n\nSo, I resort to telling her myself. I have told her about ten times over the past few months that she smells like urine. I try to be polite but I know I come off as a bit rude. I then get my mom chiming in saying \"stop being rude\". She has pulled me aside multiple times saying not to bring it up because I am making it up for attention (?) and I just want her in trouble. She claims she smells nothing.\n\nIt has gotten so bad to the point that in the store I need to stray a few feet behind to not gag. I can't do anything.\n\nAbout a week ago my mom pulled me aside and said something along the lines of \"you need to stop telling your sister she smells. I don't smell anything and if you're trying to get her in trouble, it's not working. When you tell her this it makes her cry and it is very rude. You will be in trouble if you bring it up again\"\n\nSo, am I the asshole for pointing it out?\n\n\nTL;DR told my sister her and all her stuff smells like urine, my mom tells me to shut it\n\n\n",

Obviously, Reddit was the answer to this conundrum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground:\n\nI'm adopted, my sister is as well. We both grew up knowing we were adopted. I was so lucky to be adopted by my parents. My family is fucking amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason my parents chose to adopt was because my mom was unable to get pregnant. They tried everything. My mom eventually had a miscarriage. She didn't know she was pregnant at the time. I think that was the turning point for them, that pregnancy wasn't possible for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now the real AITA Story:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom saw a used pregnancy test in the trash and basically said \"I'm here for you, do you need to talk about anything, etc\" .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was negative. I knew it would be. Shoutout anxiety disorder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReassured her I was not pregnant, that got us to joking about if I was pregnant and I said to her \"No worries. If I was pregnant I'd yeet that ball of cells out with a pill.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second I said that her face was just sad. She looked so hurt.  In no way was I trying to be mean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept thinking how I have no idea what she went through, how many doctors she saw, how much money it cost, just to raise a child. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been eating away at me. If IATAH, advice on how to rectify the situation would be greatly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*note: my mom is pro-choice\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He asked to me to do the favor of hiding these items or  do whatever i want with them. Because apparently the cops know about him stealing these items and they’re most likely doing some investigation. I asked him several times to tell me what happened, he replied by saying the less you know the better and said that he’ll tell me the full story tomorrow. I told him that im not gonna do him the favor unless he tells me what exactly is going on in detail right at that moment. He insisted that he can’t tell me right now. I asked why ask me for the favor and not someone else, he said he does not have anyone else. So i said no and he took a train back home. Which means he spent money to go to my house, and go back (expensive train) to get nothing out of it. Now i do feel bad, because he has done me a lot of favors but i just had to sit this one out.

      "description": "So I live in a house with 8 guys, needless to say its a masculine environment. A few weeks ago a girlfriend moved in so now there is at least some female presence (this is not the girl in question). \n\nI've never been an active pursuer of women, all of my previous girlfriends have approached me first. This isn't because I'm not interested, its just I am very shy and when a girl approaches me I find it very attractive. Anyway, another one of my roommates (Jo) has a girlfriend (Steph) who is frequently around at our house and she is very flirty with me. SHe's flirty with everyone in a very non-threatening way, but especially so with me. For example, I'll be working in the living room and Steph will come out and sit next to me, when Jo comes out looking for her she will grab my arm and lay her head on my shoulder then some something strange and leave with Jo.\n\nI've started to feel feelings for her, and her behavior only strengthens them. If we're hanging out in a group and she leaves, she'll do the standard give everyone a hug thing, but she will kiss my cheek. She doesn't kiss the other guys. She and I have long eye contact sessions, and I feel like she feels something also. She once even said that I was her favorite guy living in my house, and she 'just sleeps with Jo, for IDK why'. \n\nLast night, she came into my room and asked for some gum. She kissed my cheek again when she was leaving. I saw it coming and really wanted to turn my head at the last second and actually kiss her. I would never do this because she is dating my good friend (Jo is an awesome human) , but that split second has replayed in my mind like 40 times today and I wish I had turned my head. This feeling makes me feel guilty, especially because I don't know for sure if she shares any of these emotions and further if she and I did anything it would ruin my friendship not only with Jo but with my entire social circle. \n\nSo, AITA for feeling these emotions and wishing that I had kissed her?",

Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?",

      "description": "Some background.. We've been dating for a few months and honestly I don't think it's working out. When we met, she was in the process of moving out of her apt and moving back into her parents house because she lost her job. I just happen to be moving into a new apt. I told her she can stay at my place when she needs to in order to help her out. So, essentially we moved in together after just a few weeks. Things were good. \nI work 60 hour work weeks and she doesn't. Most of time I'm at work, she's at my place. She has little babysitting jobs n what nots but I'm starting to get to the point of where I feel like I'm putting in the majority of the work, both financially and relationship wise. Most days I come home and she's just there. Hanging out. \nI have some time off work coming up during the holidays and I want to travel somewhere warm but I realize I'd be the one that has to pay for us both. I make okay money so that's not necessarily the issue. I just feel like I'm contributing a lot while my return on investment is subpar. \nShe's been introducing me to her whole family and slew of friends, and they all love me. She tells me all the time how \"weird\" I am when I do goofy stuff and I've told her repeatedly that being called that bothers me but yet it happens again. She tells me she means it in a cute way. \nI feel like it's almost a drag to come home after work knowing she'll be there. We have all these plans with her family for the holidays and I'm not sure how to handle this situation during this festive time.",

      "title": "AITA for telling a teacher that I was worried about my friend’s mental health?",
      "description": "My friend frequently talks about being depressed and limiting her calorie intake drastically in order to lose weight. I also have depression and often joke about it, but mine is much less severe than hers. She started off with making jokes about being depressed and but it quickly escalated into long rants about how much she hates herself and how she lives off of about fifty calories and still feels obese. \n\nFinally, on a day where she constantly showed us eating disorder memes and making depression jokes, a couple of her other friends convinced me to tell a teacher with them. We were all worried about her, and the teacher agreed that she showed signs that were concerning to her as well. The teacher told the guidance counselor, who in turn told the friend’s parents.\n\nThe friend immediately texted me and began to accuse me of trying to ruin her life. She said that I had lied to the teacher and  was going about trying to help her in the wrong way. I responded that no, I hadn’t been lying and that it was the only way I knew how to help since I’m a young teenager and not a therapist. She says that she was only making those kinds of jokes because I did and she was just trying to fit in with me, but I have never once joked about having an eating disorder and the way she talks about these topics don’t feel like jokes. I eventually decided to stop arguing with her because she was most likely just deflecting her anger onto me.\n\nAnyways, flash forward several months to now and she still constantly brings it up, saying that she has to watch her every word so she doesn’t get reported again and that she can no longer trust any of her friends. She doesn’t target any of the other friends who told the teacher and seems to focus only on me.  I’ve said countless times that we did it because we were concerned and not to hurt her but she doesn’t listen and assumes that we did it to ruin her life. \n\nI don’t feel like I can tell her that she’s making me feel uncomfortable because she would take it as a personal attack against her, I can’t tell the teacher that I’m concerned again because I don’t want a repeat of last time, and I can’t distance myself from her without worrying that she’ll relapse into “everyone hates me” territory.\n\nI know that her mental health is bad and probably affects the way she’s acting towards me, but I still feel hurt every time she says that she doesn’t trust me or thinks that I hate her. Am I being an asshole here?",

      "description": "So this starts back when I was a little kid, maybe 6-9 or more or less, I can’t really remember. But this has been on my mind this morning for some reason.\n\nAnyways, we had these family friends that had two kids, one was a year younger than me and the other was 6 months or so younger than me. Anyways these kids were absolutely ruthless in every way, it was really weird how quickly they would transform into these destruction machines. They would come over to my house, throw my shit on the floor even while I was trying to stop them, their parents wouldn’t believe me for some reason, they had thought I did it in defiance or whatever. \n\nThey would destroy these boxes I would keep from my nerf guns, I didn’t really care but they held sentimental value to me, even as a child. I’ve always been one for nostalgia. They would bang on the door whenever I would go to the toilet, and they would just slobber everywhere and sneeze on everything, it was a hassle.\n\nSometimes I would have to go to their place, sometimes it was pretty fun, we would play games and whatnot. But sometimes it would not be fun at all, one time at a birthday party one of them got their friends to chase me down with screw drivers and stuff, I honestly thought I was going to die even though they probably wouldn’t of stuck me with them. I was just a kid after all. He got me on the ground and waved it in my eye, was very scared.\n\nAnyways enough of their shenanigans, apart from that they were pretty fine, their parents were great people apart from refusing to believe they fucked my room up lol, and I had some fun with them back in the day. Our parents don’t talk anymore and I think it’s because of a few reasons, one of the kids has now grown up to be a douchebag and the other I have no idea, but he would always get in trouble at school for fighting the other kids, I wasn’t there, that’s just what I heard.\n\nSo I guess all of this got to me, subconsciously or consciously, my mum was on the phone with the parents and she asked if they wanted to come over, as a small child I was retarded and basically was like “NOOOOO” in the background, I dunno if the other line heard me but who knows, whenever they would come over I would just play the Xbox and they’d sit and watch so they would be quiet, I guess I would act unenthusiastic or not pumped for them to be there, we got in to our fair share of fights, especially when one of them broke my human anatomy skull that had taken me ages to put together with my father, he broke it infront of my face because I told him not to. So we fought because of that and cried and etc etc. \n\nAnother time was when the other kid broke my robot cat that my mum gave me. Everything my parents gave me was sacred. They also had this cousin that would come over when I came over to their house, and he would try and one up me and basically bully me, I fucking hated Sam, what a cunt. \nBut yeah I guess I’d retaliate, you could say kids are kids but should I have been more patient with them? Even though I was just kinda learning? I’m feeling a little bad about it, regardless of the craziness of the kids.\nAm I the child asshole?\n\nTL;DR\n\nTwo kids terrorised child me and we got into physical and yelling fights and I would really not want them to come over.\n",

      "description": "I have several younger sisters. The ones involved here are 17 and 14, respectively.\n\nI worked a gaming convention the other weekend. My university's esports organization was invited to host an Overwatch tournament at the convention, and I had offered my help in setting up for the tournament. Day one of convention comes, and I realize it's the last few days of younger sister's (17 year old btw) spring break (mine was the week following) and I thought she might enjoy coming. She's very into fighting games and the like, and there were tourneys and open matches happening, so I thought she would like to come. I called her and she was ecstatic. She went both days.\n\nThe issue herein is that my other younger sister, who is 14, heard, and became jealous. She went to my dad, who texted me and said that I was being mean for not inviting her to come. 14 year old sister has some issues with crowds (her and I have autism and can't handle large crowds) and she really isn't interested in gaming whatsoever. She wouldn't have had fun at the convention. 14 year old sister also does not have a cell phone. If she were to have come she would have to have stayed with me the whole time (as per my parent's rules) which would have made the experience more unfun for her. Older of the two has no issues with crowds and can handle herself much better than the younger can.\n\nTLDR, invited older of younger sisters to a con, younger was jealous she couldn't come despite it not being something she would enjoy, and I would not have been able to keep a good eye on her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Little bit of context, sorry for the length:\n\nI'm fresh out of school and working in a big city I have to commute to. I currently live with my mom (can't afford housing/need to pay off student loans), who I have never gotten along with from childhood to now. I pay rent, help around the house, etc. Part of my commute is a drive to the transit station where I take the train. Since my mom goes to the same transit station in the morning, I ride with her. \n\nNow my mom is, by her own admission, a bad driver in darker conditions. She is also getting up there in age, but still has to work. She has, repeatedly, worried me with her driving. She doesn't signal or look when changing lanes. She doesn't put her headlights on. She makes wide turns that bump into the curb. She has, on multiple occasions, bumped into snow or other cars while parking. \n\nI started out asking her to drive safer, and the reasons why I was concerned. Every time I brought it up, she yells and screams, essentially telling me to shut the fuck up. This fits into a pattern of her yelling and getting angry for minor things (like not covering microwaved Jamaican patties, a recent example). I've stopped pointing them out because I don't want to be yelled at, and I've started taking the bus. I can't drive the car for her because of insurance costs. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for pointing her bad driving habits out? \nShe makes me feel like a terrible human being, and I need some perspective",

      "description": "r/AskWomen\nWould anyone consider this creepy?\nu/TheEpicThrowaway865\nSo around a year ago I asked a girl out, let's call her Max. I was rejected, which sucked but I reacted in a respectful manner and moved on pretty quickly. It was the final day of the school year, so a long time to just forget eachother. Months pass and I find out she has a new boyfriend through her insta. The guy is pretty cool and they seem like a good couple. A few months after that, I'm at the local bowling alley waiting for my dad to finish his last few games. It's getting a bit boring so I walk around the central bar area of the place listening to some of my music. Around my 3rd or 4th time around I think I see someone familiar looking but keep walking. I keep wondering who it was so I look again when I come back to that area and It looks a lot like Max and her boyfriend. Keep in mind I am always walking and don't ever stop directly at this point. I'm a bit scared that she thinks I keep walking over to see her and that I'm trying to be intimidating or something. I sit down and stop walking around to avoid making the situation worse . Later, as my dad and I walk out to leave, he sees a few of his friends and starts to talk with them, leaving me standing alone in the center of the bar area. I think I looked at the silhouette of the girl and I saw her pause and turn around to talk to the guy and her group. It's too dark and I can't actually see if its really them or what exactly is occurring. I try to act as casual as I can and look at my phone and the TV screen in the bar but I don't actually move from where I am. After I left I'm thinking about everything that happened and I'm kinda scared that it actually was Max and now she thinks I'm a total creep/I'm still into her. Is this something that would be seen as a big deal? Do you guys think she would spread this around provided it's her? I'm also worried about my school reputation. AITA?\n",

      "description": "I'm just gonna get straight into this, no need to give a huge intro. I'm a (white) high school freshman with two Asian friends. We'll call one of them #, and the other one %. # is someone who often makes Asian jokes about himself. Jokes about \"Asian Eyes\", about how he eats dogs and cats, shit like that. Harmless stuff. On Halloween, he dressed up as a chef and was pretending to serve his cat to his neighbors. %, on the other hand, doesn't make jokes like that at all. So I'd been talking with # earlier in the day, and he made this hilarious joke. % was in a class with me, and I just thought of the joke that # told earlier. I said the joke to him (I'm omitting the joke on purpose, just in case anyone does find it offensive). He just kind of looks at me, then says \"What the fuck, dude?\" and turns away. % is actually the nicest kid I know, and I actually hadn't heard him swear ever before. Ever since then, he hasn't talked to me much at all, and every time he has, he's just been very cold to me. I know that % has heard # tell Asian jokes before, and they're friends with each other. % has no problem with it.\n\nAll the information has been layed out. AITA for telling a racist joke to someone who may find it offensive? Saying it like that makes me feel like an asshole, but the circumstances which surrounded it make me unsure. I really don't want to lose the friendship of %, so I need your verdicts so that I know how to act accordingly to save this friendship.",

I have an older half brother that didnt do well on his exams, so she projects onto me, and she had to redo some of her gcses, so she projects onto me. She constantly asks if i want to be like my cousin who only did her english and maths exams as she has severe anxiety and depression. She says i will be forced to go to to school A, when i really want to go to school B as school A doesnt have any of the subjects i want. Legally i get to chose, not according to her. Whenever she shouts at me i cry beccause she had an emotionally abusive ex who shouted at me ages 7-12.

There’s a lot of detail and such, this post would be too long if I got into it, so to the point. My parents have already freaked out about me moving states away, and my mom has even made a comment to my older sister and I about keeping important things like marriage not necessary a secret from her but really keeping her out of the loop about it and she would be really hurt if we planned it without her knowing. Anyway, my boyfriend and I have been thinking about eloping and then later in a few years after we’ve saved up money to have the actual ceremony. I’ve told him we can just call the in between the “engagement” but honestly if anyone asks I’ll say I’m married because I love him and in no way am I going to keep this a secret. I honestly have no idea how to go about this with my family though. I know he’s the one for me, and he feels the same way 100% about me, there’s no doubt or fear for either of us about our relationship, we’ve talked about this for several months and this is what we both want.

      "description": "Hi! So this has been an issue for a while now. I'd take a random photo around town and send it to a closr family member, only to find she has almost immediately posted it to her fb.\nInitially, I simply said 'hey, didn't think you'd upload it but oh well' and left it there. No direct response to that from her. I forget about it until it happens again, this time with pictures from my holiday. I have my own fb and did not upload the pictures I sent her, but hey, I guess she got excited.\nYesterday, it happened again, because of course she would. She even texts me to inform me she has submitted it to one of her fb groups. I get annoyed at this point, telling her I sent it to her in private and she could've at least asked. She says 'well, it's no big deal, it's not like anyone can see it.' Right. I've shown her before how many of her details can be seen publically, but that's not even the point. She did not take the pictures to begin with, and I really only wanted to share them with her. I say 'well, I don't like you uploading them without asking, and they're not exactly private on fb.' I don't want to get into a fight over this. Not that I could, because I'm now getting the silent treatment. I'm apprehensive about sending her other photos now, which is a shame, because I travel a lot and like to keep her involved.\nAlso, I did send her a ton of pictures from a recent trip we took together. They would actually have made sense to upload for her. She did not post a single one of those.\nOkay, so this is the situation now. AITA for taking issue with this? Thanks for any input :)\nHappy new year!",

      "description": "We were playing together and one of our teammates was doing stuff that was a bit questionable. \nMy boyfriend noticed that the username of the player was girly and started talking about how bad girls are in video games and kept referring to girls as bitches. I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? ",

      "description": "1am Last night. I Was in bed, on my phone, when my fiancé, who'd got back from a long shift 1½ hours earlier, walked into the room. He started out sounding apologetic, \"I Know it's my mess, and you won't like this but...\" Then basically asked me to gather up all his clothes for work tomorrow afternoon and put them in the wash\n\nI Said no, after looking at the time and realising, to my surprise, it was one o'clock already, and I had to be up early. Also I didn't want to set a presitent that its okay to get me out of bed that late to do chores\n\nHe became annoyed, saying it needed to be done as he had work again at 4pm the next day, and also pointing out that I've been for nights out on a work night with him before, yet I won't do this\n\nThis made me feel bad and I wondered if I was just being lazy\n\nIn order for you to make your judgment, I want you to know the whole context, so here's our timelines for the day–\n\nMe:\n\n° Got up at 5:30am and did a just-over.1hr long commute to work for a 2hr shift\n\n° After work, spent a few hours running around for last minute wedding shopping\n\n° Once finally home, took the dog out to the bathroom, then chilled for an hour or 2 messing about on the laptop\n\n° Then washed my hair and began cleaning and tidying around the house\n\n°When he got in, I had some of the food he'd brought back and was in bed chilling on my phone by 1, I needed to get up for work again the same time the next morning\n\nHim:\n\n°Not sure when he got up, but he headed off at about 2:30 or 3p for an hour long bike ride\n\n°He was in work for about 6hr I think, had another 1hr long ride home in the cold dark and rain, arriving at 11:30pm (You can see why he was tired)\n\n°Upon arriving he asked me to run a bath for him and  relaxed in there for a while before coming  to be in work again for 4pm the next day.\n\nIf you're wondering why I was awake so late seeming as I needed to be up early, it was because I'd been waiting for him to come home seeing as I hadn't seen him all day, and then I just lost track of time\n\nHis arguments for me doing the laundry for him would be this:\n\n° I Was still awake anyway\n\n°He'd had a much longer working day and more difficult commute than me, and had not long got back, so he was tired whereas I'd been home for hours\n\n°He needed his clothes washed and dried for the next day so it had to be done then and there\n\n°I've Been out drinking in work nights before so should be able to do this",

      "description": "I was always interested with history. Naturally I have a good knowledge about my country and the countries which is have been in same geography before my country. I am from Turkey. On March 31 mayor elections happened and everyone still talking about results. I couldn't gave my vote because I am living in outside of the country. I am not supporting any specific party. I am supporting Kemalist ideas ( founding ideology of Republic of Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ). I can easily say that I am against the AKP (Justice Ana Development Party, current government ) ideology. I had a conversation with my friend about election results yesterday. He said he is sad because AKP lost on 3 biggest city ( İstanbul , Ankara and İzmir). \n\nTo explain my action , I will give some personal opinion. \n\nI think AKP trying to leave the society uneducated for getting vote without doing anything. They have power on all government and Justice departments. Most of the supporters of them are uneducated. The other supporters are feels like they have to support AKP to get right Justice service and get a better job. Because many job availability is under AKP's hand. This topic is so deep and I don't want to turn this post to a political post. \n\nAfter my friend said that , I asked him \" why are you supporting AKP ? \". He said \" Erdogan ( head of AKP and president of Turkey ) is the most holy person who came in history of this country and Erdogan makes our economy better etc .\". His speech is not depends on any official truth. I can easily give so many examples that our economy is not good but the supporters of AKP are mostly bindly believing only the information came from Erdogan's mouth. When I asked him \"What about Kemalism ?\". He said \" Everything would be better if Erdogan had lived then in Atatürk's position \". He talked like Atatürk did nothing for this country and he claimed me traitor because I am a Kemalist. On his opinion I have no idea about real history. \n\nI got very angry and I said \" You will probably die with your low knowledge as a happy and poor person. Don't even think about talking like that about Atatürk again you ignorant fuck ! \". \n\nAITA for telling that because of different opinions ?",

      "description": "My step brother and I (both 17M) were put into braces about 3-4 months ago. I'm sure many of you know, braces are insanely expensive as they charge around 5 grand per person for 1 visit per month for 18 visits that last at most 30 minutes. But thats not the point. \n\nEver since we were put into braces, my mom has needed extra money to help pay the $300 a month. So she bought a booth at a local flea market for about $200 a month and now she sells crafts that she makes aswell as some jewelry. The problem is that she still has't broke even on the starting prices of her booth.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and bash her crafts and jewelry, because I think some of them are awesome. She resells some jewelry snaps that she buys online and she makes a bunch of holiday themed items and gifts. She made a few ornaments that I really liked, but thats besides the point.\n\nLike I said, she hasn't made any profit so far, and it's devastating to me. She works 7 days a week (5 days shes at her real job, and the other 2 working the booth) and she's exhausted, but keeps doing it. She has spent so much time trying to pay for me and my step brother's braces, and I'm extremely grateful.\n\nHere's where the AITA is, though. I was thinking about giving some money to some friends at school to go and buy some of her things, just so she can be a little happier about making more money. The reason I think I'm the asshole though is that these wouldn't be honest customers. For all the time and money my mother has spent, I think it would be really mean if I pay friends to buy a bunch of her stuff.\nSo, am I an asshole for wanting to do this?\n\ntl;dr:\nMom works booth at flea market, trying to pay for me and my step brother's braces. She still hasn't made any profit, and the amount of work she puts in bugs me (had to do the pun). I am going to give friends money to buy some of the stuff she makes, but these would be dishonest customers, and I would feel awful if all her hardwork is repaid by her son's pity money. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "First time posting.\nContext: It was a Friday night and we went for drinks after work. We started as a large group and split off and moved to a busy bar. We managed to get a booth and we had all had quite a lot to drink. Throughout the night people were moving around the building and getting split up making it difficult to find each other. As I checked the last train my phone died so I left and noticed a backpack left at the booth we were at, I took it with me assuming it was a colleagues. When I came in Monday it was clear this bag didn't belong to anyone, we searched through to find some identification but the bag was largely empty. One of my colleagues says I should try and return it but I don't think it's worth the time to recreate the journey across the city. Am I the Arsehole?",

      "description": "Throwaway because some people know my main reddit account. I’m 16F btw. Let me just preface this by saying I really do try to be polite to the staff and I have a great relationship with all of them-except one maid, who I’ll call S. Mum hired her four months ago and oh. my. God.\n\nShe never cleans, she misplaces things every single day, she’s constantly on her phone, but most importantly: she has MASSIVE body odour problems. I’m not even exaggerating when I say I have never come across someone who, firstly, smells so, SO bad, and secondly, is so completely oblivious to it. I asked mum to offer to buy S toiletries like toothpaste or deodorant but S said she already had her own. A couple of weeks passed and the body odour just got worse so my mum bought her toiletries anyway and seriously talked to S abt fixing the problem. S was surprised (she didn’t think she had a BO problem AT ALL) but said she would fix it\n\nA couple of weeks pass and still no change. It’s gotten to the point where I literally hold my breath for five seconds when S passes. One Sunday (the day S takes her holiday) was when I finally realised-and I know this sounds awful to say but- how much better the entire day was when S wasn’t there. None of my things were misplaced or lost and the house didn’t stink. Even the staff keeps complaining to mum about S never working and mum keeps talking to her but there’s no change. I’ve complained to mum several times, and she’s talked to S about the BO issue thrice but S hasn’t done anything.\n\nSo I went and talked to my mum again and  told her that she hired S to do a job and not only was she not doing it, she was literally making things 100 times worse, always losing our stuff and her body odour was unbearable. My mum got a bit annoyed at me and said I had to stop being a brat and just deal with it now, and when I said I’ve been trying to deal with it for four months, mum said S needed the money and we couldn’t just fire her, so I suggested giving her three months salary as a leave package.\n\nThen my mum REALLY got annoyed, started going on about how you can’t just fling money at people and expect it to solve problems. She said I was heartless and had no sympathy. I apologised to mum for being ‘heartless’ but I said I still stood by my argument. Mum isn’t too annoyed at me but said she wants me to work on my sympathy for others and ‘softening my heart.’ THEN, mum said I could choose whether to fire her but I couldn’t bring myself to do it (and mum absolutely knew this) so now I’m just back where I started. Mum talked more abt working on my sympathy and now I feel bad about trying to get S fired but still frustrated and just want unbiased opinions as to whether I’m being an asshole.\n\nTLDR; I tried to convince my mum to fire a maid because she never works, only goes on her phone but most importantly stinks up the entire house.

      "description": "Let me start off by saying that I'm in a very happy relationship and I love my boyfriend. I have not cheated on him at least physically. I have not directly lied to him about it either. There is another guy who I had lot of classes with and we used to study together regularly. I thought we were good friends. About a year or so ago, we didn't have any classes together and he kind of stopped hanging out completely with me. This has left me with lot of feelings that I don't know how to process. Whenever I come across him I become restless. Whenever I tried to ignore it, I've had some intense dreams about him which made it even harder. So instead of completely ignoring the feelings I now think about it a bit, try to rationalize them and eventually get over them . I try my best to avoid his path but I end up seeing him at unexpected times and  I have to get over him all over again. I have not initiated any contact with him after I started to have feelings. However I do feel like an asshole because I think I'm emotionally cheating. I don't know how else to deal with the situation. ",

At first A and I were good friends, we didn't hang out as much though as I was dating someone at the time and wanted to be respectful of my boyfriend by not hanging out with other guys alone. Long story short my boyfriend cheated on me and we broke up. A was the second closest person I was closest to and we talked more and more as I was completely heartbroken. About a month goes by and we're talking (we've gotten closer now) and A said he had a crush on me while my boyfriend and I were still dating and after thinking it through for a few days I tell him that I like him too. I ask him out a bit later and it's been going good for about a week now.\n\nI'm scared of telling my mom he's trans- especially since I haven't told her we're dating yet. A says it's ok that my mom doesn't know so that we can sleep over and go on dates and my mom will see it as a girl thing and not us dating but I feel like I'm exploiting his gender. ",

I have invited a mutual friend of my BF and I over a few times and I have had my best friend over a few times as well.\n\nBoth have stayed the night before.  However with my boyfriend's friends I find myself not comfortable with them being over.  One friend especially, who'll I'll call James.\n\nAll the times James has come over, he'll stay for 6+ hours.  After a few times he did it I asked my boyfriend to talk to him about it.  Not long after that talk, James got mad at something my boyfriend did and came to our home without an invite and I told my boyfriend that I was not allowing him in the house.  Then James asked if I could call him an Uber after he and my boyfriend shared a cigarette outside.  I couldn't afford it and my boyfriend told James I refused because he showed up uninvited.\n\nThen James comes over and my boyfriend doesn't tell me.  I spend 6 hours down stairs waiting until he leaves because he makes me uncomfortable.  I tell my boyfriend I don't want James to come over any more and I want to discuss it with him.  My boyfriend deflects the conversation and I end up feeling guilty, because I say this could push me away.  I felt like I was using guilt to try and get my boyfriend to side with me.\n\nMy bf says he's not always comfortable with James's visits but feels even more uncomfortable telling him to leave.  I don't want James over anymore and am prepared to talk to James myself.  First I would like to know...am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend's friend always stays too long when he comes over.  He makes me uncomfortable and I don't want him over anymore.",

      "description": "Recently I went on an overseas holiday with my long term girlfriend, we had a wonderful time bar one particular incident.\n\nWhile on holiday we were waiting to catch a bus. Being in a foreign country navigation can be a bit difficult. My girlfriend was adamant we had to catch the bus numbered 21 to our destination because she had seen it on a sign at the main bus depot. I suggested we call the bus provider and ask just to be certain. She was very anti this idea for reasons I cannot comprehend and was certain this was the bus we had to catch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to sneakily give the bus provider a ring as I was genuinely unsure if this was the right bus stop and I didn't want to end up going to the wrong place. Turns out the bus we needed was not number 21 but number 22! I said to my girlfriend we needed to catch the 22 not the 21 and \"luckily I checked\". I did not mean this in a nasty way but I must have sounded condescending. She replied with \"You're such a sexist pig\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was honestly shocked. I have never considered my self to be sexist and asked her to explain. She said I was a chauvinist because I would not have double checked if it had been one of my friends (presuming she meant male friends). I thought this was really unfair as I have always tried to treat her with respect, I have even moved across country for her to pursue her career. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so upset by what she said I decided to treat her like a male friend for the remainder of the day. This started when we got on the bus with only one seat being available. Normally I would let here take the seat while I stood. Not today, I decided to grab the seat and let her stand which is what I would have done with a male friend. This continued for the rest of the day as I proceeded to not get the door for her, carry her coat etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came to dinner I generally order and take care of the bill when we are on holiday. This time I decided to ask her to grab the bill as I had paid for dinner the previous night. I could see she was upset by this point but at the time I thought I should make my point. By the next day i had gone back to normal but I could tell she was upset by my behaviour the previous day. I didn't do anything nasty, I just treated her with equality as if she was my male friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for behaving this way? I now feel as if I was a bit sensitive with what she said and may have taken it too far, especially with the dinner situation? I was always raised to treat Women with respect and be chivalrous so I feel as if my actions were poor now.",

I just constantly tell her to put on headphones or I'll leave the room. Both she doesn't like.

      "description": "So I worked for my father for about 10 years, and it had its fair share of ups and downs. We had many blowouts over the years, and not all of them were just his or my fault, we are both difficult to deal with sometimes. Well it progressively got worse over the past several months, to the point where even after work I did not want to talk with him because of resentment. \n\nSo I decided for the benefit of us both I was going to quit working for him, I have quit many times in the past, but always end up going back, and getting into the same cycle. This time I have had enough, because instead of arguing about work or whatever it was, I increasingly was getting my character picked apart, usually for things that had nothing to do with the original dispute. I decided no matter what I was not going back.\n\nI am 25, and moved back in with my father about 3 months ago, when my life kinda got turned upside down. This contributed alot to us not getting along, because we worked together and lived together. \n\nSo I decided to tell him I was done working, and at first he was ok with it. Well I agreed to help him finish one part of the job before I left, and did so, but when it came time to leave, I get accused of always quitting at the last minute, bailing on him when he needs me most. I pointed back to our agreement, but it did not matter I was not right for leaving in this manner. Well this reinforced the reasons why I wanted to quit in the first place, I am tired of guilt trips, and getting accused of crazy things ( he accused me of planning out quitting at the most inconvenient moment for him, that was just the last accusation before i was done). A week after I had quit he called me, and said because I didnt help him carry some heavy components of the job upstairs 3 weeks prior that I now have to go to work and help him do this part of the job. I tell him that was 3 weeks ago, and to blame me is unfair, (he did ask to take them up on the first day, but we talked about it, and i pointed out that they  would be in the way of all the other work we had to do. It made sense then, and after we got finished with those parts he never asked to carry them up again). Well I say sorry I dont work for you anymore, and you cant just tell me I have to come to work for you. He says that because of my laziness I have made the job very difficult for him, and that because I have not paid much rent that I have to come work for my rent, literally the night before this I had offered rent, but he did not accept it, and now he says he didnt accept it because i didnt have the right attitude when offering it.\n\nOver the two weeks since I have quit, I have been told that I dont want to work, I have no initiative, I dont want to pay rent, I dont want to clean the house, I dont want to help anyone, but myself. Mind the fact that I have offered rent on a few occasions, I have swept, vacuumed, done dishes, and taken care of their dog, just about everyday since I quit. I have also been putting in applications to various jobs, and looking into schooling.\n\nWell my Fathers GF worked with us sometimes as well, and she was supposed to help him with a job. Well they have gotten into one of there many arguments, and she has left (she will probably be back this happens usually about once a month or so). So he is left to do the job on his own. \n\nMy father, the day after she leaves come barging in my room, at 8 in the morning. He says he really needs help, and is just very stressed because of his situation, I didn't want to say no I've made my mind up and I can't work with you, because he was already in a bad mood. So I just said dude I am very tired, and I had no idea that this was going to happen. He comes in three more times and just stands there pouring on the guilt trip, I just roll in bed, and tell him I didnt get much sleep, and I was not expecting to need to work today, sorry, but I cant do it. As he is walking out I hear him talking under his breath, and I dont know if its about me, but I can tell he is not happy with me, and is a pissed off that i wont help him.\n\nShould I have helped? Or am I right for standing my ground? I feel like he tries to manipulate my emotions to get what he wants, hence the reason he gets so angry when i refuse him.\n",

      "title": "WIBTA for telling my dad's wife her family's not my family?",
      "description": "**Context**: my dad remarried last year. His new wife never had any children of her own;  when she came into the picture, my siblings and I were living independent/semi-independent lives. She's lovely, but very spoiled and sheltered for a woman in her mid-fifties. I have seen the woman cry because she doesn't get her way, it's not pretty.\n\nI'm a solo mum to a very well-behaved seven year old and finishing my BA. Usually, he goes to class with me and he actually likes it, but I have a three hour class once a week that ends around 10 PM. My dad and his wife live close by, they love playing the part of the indulgent grandparents, and my dad's wife is okay with watching him once a week.\n\n**Problem**: last week when I picked my kid up, he was bawling over trivial shit. My dad's wife asked him to not take home a book - this specific book had been my brother's, but he gave it to my dad, who in turn passed it on to my kid - thinking my brother still wanted to keep it. We go home and he insisted he was upset over the book, but I had the feeling it was something else.\n\nI mentioned this to his counselor and after his weekly play therapy session, she tells me that my kid expressed why he's upset. My dad's wife has been having her older brother over for dinner nearly daily and she's pushing my kid to interact with him. The main issues my son has with this are:\n\n* all my kid wants to do after being done with his homework and reading is to be left alone to play Minecraft or with his toys;\n* my dad's wife will turn off the tv/take away the tablet/shoo him out of her bedroom so they can all have dinner and \"family time\" together, calling her brother my kid's uncle;\n* my son just doesn't like her brother (he calls him \"the sad adult\", which is ... accurate), so pushing interaction between them makes my son feel deeply fucking annoyed and uncomfortable.\n\nMy kid's counsellor tells me he's having trouble expressing the big feelings of frustration and stress that pushing these interactions on him is causing him, and it translates into outbursts like crying jags over \"nothing\".\n\nMy dad insists that something is wrong with my kid, anything from blood sugar to \"sociopathy\" (which, what the fuck, dad?). I am hesitant to mention to him what the actual problem is, because I pretty much know that telling them what the real problem is will mean dealing with a middle-aged woman throwing a tantrum.\n\nI've decided to take my kid to that class with me from now on, since I'm three weeks away from finishing the term anyway and also because I'm not okay with this situation.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I point out to my dad and his wife that her pushing her family (and, more specifically, her brother) on my son and me and calling them our family is the problem, and that this shit needs to end ASAP?",

      "description": "So my SO of 3 years went to a massage out of town with her mother over the weekend, we live in the U.S just to clarify and she is not a legal adult yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo she told me the next day that she got the massage from a younger guy, though she had booked a female one. Anyways, the massage table had no blankets when she walked in and there was just a table and the towel she could wear.  As she gets in the room the masseur tells her to take of her clothes. So up until this point it seems standard to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe masseur then tells her to take of her bra (redflag for sure) and she complies. Then he proceeded to take of her underwear without consent (another major redflag). She says nothing to the masseur, though she told me she felt very uncomfortable at this point (she assumed this is how massages work as she had never gotten one). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe lies flat on her front and the masseur begins to massage her legs. He goes all the way up to her inner thighs that he touched her p\\*\\*sy,  again she said nothing of it. He then told her to turn on her back and sit up (she had been wearing a towel around her to cover her breasts), and he proceeds to tell her to put her hands up in the air, to which her towel fell to the ground (again she thought this was standard procedure). The masseur began to massage her bare breasts (without asking or anything of the sort). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked to her the next day to see if she was okay and she just laughed the thing off saying it wasn't a big deal and that she just didn't want to make a scene. I got upset with her because I felt that she should've said something because she was uncomfortable and the whole story didn't sit well with me (being her BF and all).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being upset with this whole situation or is this normal for a massage?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nGot mad at under 18 girlfriend who was uncomfortably touched by masseur and she didn't contest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My father used to be a heroin addict. He went to prison for for his second offense of trafficking stolen goods (he stole jewelry from my grandma and his sister.) He came out to live with us with his pregnant girlfriend and can't keep a job. It's been four years since, he's had two kids, and no steady income. Recently, he's been stealing from my grandparents. A lot. I mean 1000's from my grandparents. No matter what they do, get new accounts, change banks, new cards, he finds their information and transfers money into their accounts. He's been pretty bad lately, and he's even taken my Xbox. We think he's pawned it. Anyways, last night I found a make up bag with needles, straws, burnt tinfoil and spoons, and a little baggy with white powder in it. After my grandparents confront him, he fesses up. But it's not heroin, no, it's Fentanyl. For those who don't know, Fentanyl is, in most cases, 100x more potent than morphine. I've decided enough is enough. He's already ruined my childhood with the last shit he pulled, and now this is the last straw. I don't want to give him a second chance. I already know how this is gonna end and I don't wanna be here to see it go down. I'm 16, a junior in highschool, and I have finals tomorrow. I don't want to deal with this. I called my aunt and she said I can live with her. My grandparents aren't happy about this but they're letting me go anyways.\n\nAm I the asshole for choosing to leave? Am I a bad person for choosing to go? Am I making the right decision? I feel awful but I'm so tired. I don't wanna do this anymore.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and a couple friends went out drinking last night. We ended the night at a karaoke bar. Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually pretty self-conscious and therefore don't participate in karaoke. This night I was feeling pretty good so I picked out a song and paid for it. The idea was that we would sing the song together. When my turns comes up she tells me I don't know the words to the song so she would sing it with her friend instead. I was pretty upset by this, so for the rest of the night (we went home like 30 mins later) I was acting kind of pouty. Then she handed me the $2 to pay for the song. This made me even angrier so I threw the money on the floor and said that I don't want it. I think what upset me was that she thought I cared about the $2 measly dollars for the song, when I actually just felt disrespected and like she wasn't being supportive. We've been together a long time, so I felt like she should have known that this was a pretty big deal for me. Like I said, I'm usually pretty quiet and just stick to my beer at karaoke bars. Anyway, this escalated into a huge fight and her saying that I ruined her night, and now I'm sitting here debating on whether or not I'm the asshole. I know I could have just let it go, but I have to admit I've been feeling kind of sad lately, and this just bothered me.",

      "description": "Alright, backstory time. \n\nI'm in a high level Biology class at uni with a lecture and lab component. The class is Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and labs involve looking at a lot of different kinds of specimens to identify structures, doing dissections, etc. The professor really only has two ground rules in lab: 1) Don't leave your scalpel out where it can cut yourself or someone, and 2) Don't use any sort of writing implement as a pointer on specimens so as not to accidentally mark on them since it can be hard to remove marks from some specimens. The prof has made these two rules thoroughly clear from day one as the only thing he'll really get mad at if he sees you doing it. I've noticed almost from the get go a student who consistently either forgets this rule or just doesn't care. AFAIK he hasn't be outright caught yet, but I had no intention of calling him out directly and snitching to the prof. I'm going to call him the Scribbler \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a recent class, we're doing a review day on skeletal anatomy. I prompted the professor to come over with a question about some structures in the lab manual but realized we don't have that particular specimen at the table so I went to the table where the Scribbler sits and asked the group if I could borrow said specimen, to which they obliged. On coming over with the specimen and asking my question, the professor noticed mild marker line across the specimen and it was clear to him it wasn't my doing since I just brought it over. He asked me where I got the specimen from, and I wasn't really thinking about it because I was focused on the material, so I just pointed to the table where I sourced it. Now I didn't realize it, but no one else at the table was using a marker except the Scribbler. The Prof immediately went over and asked Scribbler if he was responsible. Scribbler goes on to categorically deny the accusation, but I guess the lab assistant had seen Scribbler do this in the past and the professor wasn't buying the feint. He chided the student, and returned to me and class resumed as normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLo and behold, after class, the Scribbler accused me of intentionally ratting him out to the professor, which makes no sense because I have literally no impetus or motive to do so, and I made that clear. I learned that it cost him 5 points from the daily lab grade (out of like, 30?) and he has to come in on a separate occasion to go through all the specimens and any specimens with marker on them. I explained what happened but he went on to call me an asshole and say that even telling the professor I got the skull from their table was a dickish move. I sorta folded and apologized and went on my way to avoid making a situation out of things. \n\ntl;dr: I accidentally outed a classmate of mine to the professor for violating one of the few ground rules of our lab class and he got scolded/a point deduction and has to come in and clean a bunch of specimens (potentially, not sure how many he's marked up). \n\nSo, y'all, AITA here? I felt sorta bad about him having to clean all the specimens, but frankly, it isn't really that hard of a rule to follow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I've been best friends with this guy ever since I met him in junior year of high school - he's always been a bit weird (politically radical), and he used to seem kinda fragile and in fact got bullied for most of high school. For most of our friendship we've been mutually best friends, hanging out twice a week, going on holiday together, etc. Now it's our second year of college (same uni) and his behavior has progressed from weird to straight-up not okay. It started with him acting rude towards me, which he later told me was an attempt at manipulation. A couple months after that he told me about a sexual conquest that *really* sounds like rape (but \"they were both really drunk and she could have said no at any time so it's ok\"). And then sorta recently he told me that he tries to manipulate friends and family on the reg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat last thing was the last straw for me - I know the rape should have been the last straw but I assumed he would come to his senses I guess. Anyhow, I ghosted him a couple weeks ago - haven't replied to any texts, removed him on social media, etc - and while I'm generally really relieved that I did, I can't help but have doubts that ghosting him was the right way to go about it. I had tried just being \"super busy\" in the weeks prior to ceasing contact but every third time I denied being able to hang out he blew up on me... so I ghosted him rather than have him blow up on me for telling him I don't want to talk anymore. A few days ago a mutual friend sent me a long text that basically says \"you shouldn't have cut X off without saying why, talk to him about whatever it is that you're mad about.\" Cue me having more doubts... so AITA?",

I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I’ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven’t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap.

      "description": "Hi all!\n\nUsing an alt account. My GF and I have been together for the better part of two years. I adore her with all I am, and love her from top to toe. Except for when she is out drinking. I am 24 and she is 23, and we're both from Norway. Before proceeding to read this, understand that Norwegian drinking culture is a little different from many other countries, and we tend to drink only on weekends, but many go out with the goal in mind of getting completely wasted.\n\nNow, my GF isn't necessarily out with a goal of becoming as drunk as possible, but her body seems to be extremely susceptible to mixing alcohol. What is the sweetest person alive becomes this absolute messwhen she drinks, and it is insanely tiring for me. It's usually one of two scenarios: We go out together with friends, and I can't enjoy myself or the people around me at all, because I feel chained to her in case she pops into toddler mode and starts doing irrational stuff, or I am home (not a huge fan of going out), and she ends up calling me, making me come and get her, if she even is at the place she told me she'd be.  \nRight now it's 4:30 am, and I'm losing my shit. She went out today for a birthday, leaving with the promise of \"Yes, I'll take it easy tonight\", only to still be out there somewhere. Luckily I have Snapchat, and I can check the map if I'm scared she's somewhere she shouldn't be, and to look at mystories. She's recently become \"friends\" with a gang I absolutely despise. They drink what seems like 3-4 days a week, and do loads of coke. She hasn't tried that yet, as she explains that she doesn't want anything to do with that. She is there right now at an after party. Went there once myself, never going back. Absolutely putrid place.\n\nAnyway, this Friday, she also went out. That evening some of my friends came over to our new apartment, to hang out, drink a few beers, and play some Smash Bros. Of course, around 1 am I receive a call from her, where she has no idea where she is, and I tell her that it's probably better if she comes home. She then proceeds to get in a taxi, call me on facetime by accident, hang up, and call again a few minutes later. She says that she's here. I go out to look, and she is nowhere to be found. Apparently, she'd given the cab driver the general area rather than the address, and she is 500 meters down the road, I scurry down to find her, and I carry her home while she's half asleep on my shoulders. I'm slightly irritated now, as she's pulled me away from my friends yet again (this has happened numerous times before). When we get back to our place, I'm just a little down, cause she keeps doing this, and my friends probably noticed too.\n\nLike, some nights she's fine, and comes home okay, usually when she hasn't mixed wine, beer, Jägermeister, Fireball and vodka, and that's completely fine. I want her to have fun, but not on my expense. I'm a very busy guy too. I have work, studies, and a very demanding position in our student union, so I really can't get enough down time, and she knows this all too well. She also keeps saying things like \"I don't know how I got so drunk\" and \"It's not my fault\", and the such. It's not like she becomes aggressive or anything, but she has gotten into serious trouble whilst drunk before. It's more like you try your hardest to communicate with her, but it's like she's a demented three year old. In other words: Absolutely impossible. I don't think she'll ever do anything drastic or life threatening, but I just still can't shake this subsisting feeling of unease. Like a constant heart rate of 120.\n\nBottom line is, am I the asshole here for wanting her to drink more responsibly? I feel like this feeling of responsibility from my side is eating me up. I hate that she hangs out with loud assholes that does cocaine, and won't give a second thought to their studies or ambitions, and I hate that I can't sleep or relax because I know that my phone is doomed to ring any second and I'll need to come and rescue her. On the other hand I feel like this is controlling of me, and has something to do with jealousy. I want her to live her life the way she sees fit, but at the same time, I need her to understand that I can't keep sitting around being worried. It's 4:30 am, and I'm leaving for a flight to a neighboring city at 08:25 tomorrow, and I am not getting any sleep tonight. I'm just so tired of all this, and I'm nearing despair. I'm really conflicted, and would love some advice.",

      "description": "Copy pasted from my post on r/confession, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/a5djs4/i_got_the_most_popular_kid_at_my_school_expelled/).\n\n(Throwaway account, **TL;DR at bottom**, writing might not be the best feel free to ask for clarification.)\n\nThis takes place at a boarding school in PA. It started maybe a week ago, I had heard that this sophomore at my high school, lets call him Beef, had a fuck load of pot in his locker to sell. A few days later I was down in the dumps after getting rejected by some girl. I just felt like fucking someone else's life up. So, I anonymously reported Beef for pot through a student community leader.\n\nNow, a few days later I get a text from a friend kinda freaking out because a whole bunch of dorm rooms, girls and boys are getting raided. Apparently they found coke or heroine in one of the bathrooms which was surprising because my school is known for pot but it's kinda preppy in the way where you shouldn't find coke or heroine, sorta hippy. Then a few minutes later while I'm laughing that a fuckload of people are getting raided, a dorm meeting is called (its around 10:00 pm at this point). The mood in the room is really sad and kind of angry in the room, apparently one of our student dorm leaders (think like camp counselor), lets call him Chad (lol) had been expelled, so I put 2 and 2 together and figured out that he had been caught in the mass bust.\n\nThe next day in class is when I found out though. This other girl was gossiping about it to me and apparently, it hadn't been coke or heroine, *it was me.*\n\nBeef actually *had* been caught because I reported him. Beef had been hiding his stuff in another empty locker and they found it. Someone tipped him off to this and he self reported before they caught him though. (At my school if you self report for drugs they let you off but only once.) They still found the matches Beef had been using though so he got suspended for that. They went through his phone to find who he had been selling to which is how so many people got caught.\n\nI was doing my best to hide how funny I thought this was that it was my fault. Plus I was hiding that I knew anything because I don't want people to hate me for narc-ing.\n\nApparently they drug tested almost 30 people and a lot came up positive which means that they all get a major strike on their record and other major discipline.\n\nThe next day, in the bi-weekly school meeting, Chad was given a chance to speak to the group and say what he needed. This guy was really well liked too, (may have been a bit of a popular dick though, I didn't really know him). So many people were crying, not just students, a bunch of teachers and deans too, even the principal was shedding a tear or two. A lot of people stood up and talked, most cried, most of whom I hate, but a few that I genuinely had respect for. One guy I really liked is even getting pulled out by his parents because of this.\n\nAt the time I was sitting in my seat trying not to laugh my ass off at how many people were crying, I don't know why it was so funny to me; a hundred crying people, all crying because of me and none of them knew it. It was genuinely the happiest I've been in a while. That sounds kind of sick though.\n\nIn talking to a friend about it they kind of think that all those people had it coming for breaking the rules and that they would have been busted eventually anyway. It seems like there is some mass bust at this place each year.\n\nSince then I think I almost feel some guilt about it but not really? IDK man. I've tried to sorta justify it by saying the guy I reported was sort of a rude dick, which I think he was? Again didn't really know him. Plus some people told me that the guy that I liked whos getting pulled out was actually a dick but I'm not sure, he gave me pizza once and chatted with me for no reason other than to be nice.\n\nAm I a bad person? I'm not without empathy, I do feel a little bad. I ruined a lot of people's week, facilitated a lot of major discipline, one guy's high school and another guys life.\n\n**TL:DR:** Reported a kid for selling pot because I was bored and felt like being a dick. Ended up getting a slew of his customers in major trouble and one of them, the most popular guy in my high school expelled. Didn't really feel bad. :P",

      "description": "Background: during a late night with our fussy daughter (6 weeks old) I opted to get up and feed her.  She finished about 3/4ths of a bottle of breastmilk, leaving about a quarter of an ounce in it.  We left it on the table.  2-3 hours later our daughter is peckish again and I gave her the rest of that breastmilk and then gave her a small bottle of formula until she fell back asleep.  My wife was awake for the first feeding but was asleep for the second.\n\nThat morning I mention I gave her the rest of the breastmilk bottle that she didn't finish.  My wife was upset, telling me that she could get really sick from stale milk because she had drank from the bottle a couple hours prior.\n\nI decided to look up online if it was true.  For formula you need to throw it out after an hour, regardless if it was touched.  But for breastmilk there doesn't seem to be any issue with it being reused, at least for up to 4 hours, since breastmilk can fight against bacteria better than formula.\n\nI sent her a link to what I had read, and the next thing I hear is a very sarcastic \"Clearly you're the better parent here, why don't you take care of her and I'll go back to work instead\" and now she'll barely talk to me and has just been livid with me all day.\n\nTL;DR: wife was upset I gave our baby leftover breastmilk that was about 2-3 hours old, showed her research it's not bad for a baby, and she doubled down against me and is even more upset.",

      "description": "Before you say \"of course NTA\" I might be in the wrong. \n\nSo I go to a college campus where they really don't want people drinking because it's caused a few incidents. They come up with events on the weekends to stop people from partying and I've been lucky enough to be chosen to host one of these events. Now this is a big event with almost 400+ and huge monetary prizes and one of my friends (let's call them W) comes a lot. \n\nW drinks a lot. He's a casual alcoholic to say the least. He brings in alcohol everyday and his excuse is \"I'm not getting drunk and it's only 8%! It's not so bad\"\n\nNow at this event, it's specifically to stop you from drinking. The event I'm helping host is being co run with our campus's center that helps people with alcoholism, addiction, sexual issues, mental health, e.t.c. \n\nThis type of event was run about 2 weeks ago and I saw W bring in a can of alcoholic cider and everyone in our friend group told him to put it away or throw it out. He chugged the whole thing and threw it out. Now I'm afraid he'll bring in drinks to this event as well and some of the following will happen: \nThe organization co hosting won't do it again because their events are specifically supposed to be dry and safe. \nHe'll be barred from future weekend events. \nHe'll get in trouble along with anyone vouching for him. \nI'll get in trouble if it's found out I knew this was going to happen.\n\nI tried to convince him to stop and he's really a nice guy but I'm getting frustrated with the excuses between \"I'll just pregane\" to \"I'll stop starting now\" to \"No one will notice! You'll be fiiiiine.\" It got to the point where I took his bottle of alcohol and wanted to flush it down the toilet because it feels like he's being plainly disrespectful to me. It got to the point where I ran into the girls room so he couldn't follow, but he did and crawled onto the floor for a $3 bottle of beer. I know that was harsh but wouldnt that be a sign of an alcoholic? (I wasnt actually gonna flush it though. I don't really have the heart to and I know this shouldn't be my problem but I feel conflicted) ",

      "description": "My older sister, Jane, was recently arrested and charged with fraud. We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this short, but some backstory:\n\nI have a friend from vocational school who has fallen on hard times. He had been moved out of state with his parents after losing a string of crappy jobs, under threat of homelessness. A reasonable decision. So he goes from a mild, damp climate to a hot, arid one, and hates it, can't get jobs there either. He tried and failed to get a flight back here, and meanwhile, he's keeping me in the know. During this time, his parents are assaulting him physically over arguments of a political nature (not going into details on this). He tells me of this, and I, caring for his safety, spend a good bit of my savings getting him back here, where he truly belongs. My wife and I laid out some basic ground rules, such as \"don't leave your shit strewn about the apartment, smoke outside, don't come in our room unless invited\", etc. We also offered to pay him $60 every two weeks while he doesn't have a job to clean the apartment, mainly so he'd have some pocket cash. Nothing gross; I deal with our cat litter. But things like loading the dishwasher, vacuuming, mostly menial tasks. He half asses everything. To the point where I had to step in and do myself what we're paying him to do. We aren't slave driving him; we gave him freedom to choose when to do it (*within reason*). But shit isn't getting done. He has applied for jobs, hasn't gotten an interview yet. He also drinks the coffee like it's water to a desert wanderer, and we've gone through on average 1 full \"mega\" roll of charmin tp per day since he's been here - wife and I can make a roll last several days, maybe a week. He had foodstamps, but blew his wad on energy drinks (!) and coffee creamer. We had 2 meals out of his $210+ food stamps, and we get to wait till next month to get more (yeah, AFTER Thanksgiving). \n\nWIBTA if I crack down on him? If I supply him with 2 rolls of tp biweekly, and a case of ramen and tell him he's not doing enough around the home?",

      "description": "My wife and I go to bed together each night together and get up at roughly the same time. She is an expat and messages her brother through Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. On the rare occasion he is free to play games with her and talk to her on skype. Because of the time difference between her and her brother (7 hours) it can be difficult to arrange these sessions.\n\nI'm more than happy for her to spend time with her family, I'll leave her to it and do my own thing for 2-5 hours while it happens. I understand how hard it is for her living away from her family and she needs to keep that relationship with them strong.\n\nMy problem is this - sometimes (not every time) she wants to spend all night playing with her brother, and when I've told her I want to go to bed at the same time as her and ask her to stop playing, she gets upset with me. I try to justify this with her and explain its important that we go to bed at the same time, because 1. I have a hard time sleeping if not next to her and 2. It has been expressed that going to bed at different times in a relationship can be detrimental to the relationship itself - it can spiral out of control and become a habit. She doesn't appear to agree to these points and tells me that she thinks the 'situation itself' is shitty.\n\nI've also talked to her about creating a schedule with her brother, so that once a week or fortnight I can sleep in the spare bedroom and leave her to do her own things, but after telling her this she tells me that her brother is quite spontaneous and her gaming sessions with him don't have any decent notice of time. (I normally say that this is his problem and he's the one that needs to sort himself out).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I loosen up and leave her to it?

I know he might be 'homeless' if he can't find a place soon, but I know if I let him stay at mine he will get comfortable and act his usual self, blaming the world for why he is in the situation he's in, and that he won't look for places or work. \n\nI don't want to have to deal with his childish bs, or have my relationship with him ruined because in a fit of anger he hits me or breaks the property, let alone me reminding him to get his own place. I figure since he's never grown up being coddled so long, he's just going to have to figure it out the hard way. I have been helping him try finding places as well, and don't mind helping a little financially though. \n\nTldr: brother with anger issues will soon be homeless and I don't want him staying at my place cos he won't likely leave\n\n(homeless as in not on the streets but mooching off somebody else, like friends 4 hours away or something)",

I gave him a dirty look as he was parking.  1.) There's more than enough room for him to park without hitting my door [maybe not from his perspective, but that's still his fault for not gauging his approach correctly.] 2.) He could have parked in the spot behind the one next to me because he was pulling in across the line to be facing forward. 3.) Isn't it common educate not to honk at people not in vehicles because horns are loud AF? [And if you do honk at someone, tooting the horn is a lot more understandable] IDK it's mildly infuriating...

      "description": "My boyfriend lives in Austin, TX and I am in Annapolis, MD for college. Originally from Pittsburgh, PA. I’ve only been dating my boyfriend for two months, but we’ve been friends for three years. We only got close in the past 6 months or so. Started dating in late December. \n\n\nI’m a full time college student six hours from home. My spring break is March 1-18th. I had originally planned on seeing my family until the 12th and my boyfriend in Austin the 12-17th. He bought concert tickets, booked a hotel in Houston, and took off work for my trip. I was excited to see my family and even more excited to see him. \n\nUnfortunately my grandmother has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. It has spread to her liver, brain, and bones. We won’t know how bad it is until her appointment March 1st but we may only have a few months. It was found during her hip replacement last week. She’s only 72 and this is completely unexpected. My grandmother is one of my favorite people in the world. I’m absolutely devastated and struggling to cope. I keep thinking about the quilt we started together but never finished, and how I can’t wait to play her in scrabble over break. I want to spend as much time as possible with her and I’m sad I’m so far away now.\n\nI told my boyfriend I wanted to maybe cancel the trip since it seems likely my grandmother could pass before my next opportunity to be home from school, and he told me I have 10 whole days to spend with her and I’m only giving him 6 days of my time. And that I’m giving her more time. And he can’t believe that I’m cancelling. He told me I can’t live my life in fear of bad things happening and I can’t feel guilty for having a life outside my family. \n\nNow I genuinely don’t know what to do here. I’ve been crying for days. I need to book a plane ticket soon if I’m going, but it feels wrong to go but wrong to cancel. \n\nAm I being unreasonable? AITA? Thanks Reddit ",

I am not an athlete and quite frankly I don't work even 10% as hard as she does at anything so I don't really understand why she is stressing and putting herself in so much pain and I suggested she take it easy and maybe explore other careers if this one is causing so much distress.

      "description": "My ex and I divorced 3 years ago. In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?",

I think about alot, as it just plays on my mind, she acts like everything is fine (deepdown probably not). But I reached the end of my tether yesterday and said she had until Easter or I cannot do this relationship anymore as its not healthy for either of us.\n\nI get its hard for her, hell its hard for most of us tellling are parents for the first time.

      "description": "So I live in Ontario, Canada and the polar vortex caused significant snow at the place I'm renting. I live in a basement apartment w/ 5-6 people for this school semester and there are probably a similar number of people who live upstairs (Idk, I haven't really met anyone upstairs). \n\nBasically, I was wondering if I'm the asshole for not shoveling a pathway and the sidewalk and telling my roommates that it's our landlords responsibility. Our lease has a one line sentence stating that tenants are responsible for snow removal and responsible for fines incurred for not shoveling the sidewalk. According to this blog post by a law firm [\\(Link\\)](https://www.sorbaralaw.com/blog/post/item/who-is-responsible-for-snow-and-ice-removal-in-a-residential-tenancy), that clause is invalid and unenforceable (without specific compensation offered for cleaning snow, which is not offered in the lease). I basically told my landlord this and he stated that our contract states that all tenants are responsible. I did so politely and simply said that the clause in the lease is not valid or enforceable, and that I don't want to shovel snow that I'm not responsible for (for free at least). \n\nAm I being an asshole here or was I justified in telling the landlord of his responsibility to shovel the snow despite our lease saying otherwise?",

      "description": "I’m a 22 year old woman living alone. My downstairs neighbors (only other apt in the house) are 3 young guys, late 20s. They’re nice guys, and we’ve been perfectly friendly so far. Been living there almost a year, we’ve hung out once where I just hung out in their apartment and had a beer and chilled for a couple hours.\n\nIt was perfectly pleasant hanging out with them that time (though they did kinda try to pressure me into drinking more than I’d want). I’ve seen them checking my ass out almost every time I see them, and I’m pretty sure they’re kinda into me. Which in and of itself isn’t an issue but it does make me wary of getting tooo friendly, for a couple of reasons. I’m not really afraid of getting raped by anyone, but don’t want to be in a situation where I’d have to reject anyone, because I think it would be kind of awkward living there after that. I also DONT want to hook up with any of them for the same reason and am not sure I trust myself enough with alcohol around them to make sure that doesn’t happen (I have poor self control).\n\nIn addition to that, I have social anxiety, and I also just don’t want to be on like a hanging out basis with them because I don’t want to feel pressured to hang out with someone when I’d rather just eat pizza and smoke weed in my bed. And it would be awkward saying no to hanging out when they can tell I’m just in my apartment by myself, you know?\n\nI got invited to a game night tonight at their place downstairs.. I said I “might” be around - which means I might find someplace else to hang tonight so i don’t look like I’m just bailing because I don’t want to hang. They asked if I had any games, which I do have some they could borrow. I’m thinking I might bring those down, hang out for half an hour or so and then escape to a friends place for the night, maybe come for another half hour or so if they’re still there when I get back (probably late).\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to form a friendship with perfectly nice people for logistical reasons/anxiety? WIBTA if I just blew them off completely? Or am I just letting my anxiety get the best of me? I don’t want to make anyone feel like I don’t like them. But I already did completely bail on a big party they had - said I would come down and just laid in my bed being super anxious all night, pretty sure they knew I was there and pretty sure I disappointed them by not coming. I just don’t wanna be a dick.\n\nTLDR don’t want to get too close to people because I don’t want awkward things to transpire. I like these people but am not looking for new friends and don’t want to reject anyone or feel obligated to hang out or have more opportunities to feel bad when I say no because I’d rather be alone.",

      "description": "My wife and I live 300 miles away from our hometown.  My mother-in-law (MIL) has this annoying a habit of inviting herself over for extended stays whenever she has time off, which lately has been every one to three months.  \n\nNot to sound like a stereotype, but her and I could not be more different, and I really do not enjoy her presence.  She is impossible to entertain, criticizes everyone and every little thing, and treats any deviation from her jaded lifestyle as a personal attack on her.\n\nBut I love my wife, so I don't refuse to allow her mother to come.  I do remind my wife though that I am forced to spend the most time with her (wife works nights and sleeps during the day), and it's painfully awkward and boring time.\n\nSo she has this shopping addiction and constantly buys things for us that we did not ask for.  If we don't immediately use what she buys us, she gets passive-aggressive and badgers us until we do.  For instance, she bought us a new curtain rod (didn't need one), and it just had to be installed right away. \n\nAt first, we would simply thank her and humor her, but in recent years, it has gotten beyond excessive.  She is slowly turning our home into a hoarding situation, and we have told her multiple times to stop.\n\nNow my wife's Aunt tries to at least make this a little better for us and tells MIL that she should buy us some outdoor tools because we haven't owned our home for very long, and we do need some stuff.\n\nSo when she comes, she buys a us a leaf blower, an edger, and a tool for trimming tree branches, all useful things, just not at this immediate instance.  Not all of the leaves have fallen, and I am not going to repeat my work two weeks from now.\n\nNow this week had kicked my ass.  All I wanted to do this weekend was my own thing.  I had not planned on her coming down, did not want to hang around with her, and definitely didn't want to do unnecessary yardwork for the sake of testing out something I didn't ask for.\n\nShe told me Friday night that we were going to do yardwork on Saturday.  I am smart enough to know that meant I would do yardwork and she would do nothing (it's happened multiple times before).  I told her that I didn't think it was necessary right now.\n\nThe next day I did my own thing like I wanted to do because I am sick and tired of feeling like I need to appease her every time she comes to my house uninvited.  She didn't even say anything to me about the yard all day, but bitched to my wife when she came home that I she wanted to do yardwork, but I refused (my wife knows better).\n\nFast forward to this morning, she leaves earlier than usual and as she's walking out the door says to my wife, \"are you ever going to use that thing?\"\n\nWhen she made it home, she texted my wife and said \"If you aren't going to ever use that stuff, I will take it home when I come down next.\"\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR Mother-in-law constantly buys me stuff I don't ask for and gets upset when I don't immediately use it. AITA?",

I had watch a certain movie that I really enjoyed and wanted the rest of the crew to see it. I specifically mentioned this to them and told them that was the reason I set up the get together. \nOn the very day of the hang out, a friend in group suggested we see a different film because he did not really like that one. I was infuriated because his concern was not mentioned earlier in the week. He suggested a second movie and I agreed hesitantly . We get to the theatre and he again changed his mind, saying we could just go home if we didn’t want the new movie he chose. This is what really pissed me off.

      "description": "I (M23) live at home at the moment after returning from university. I pay rent every month which goes to helping out with food and bills etc. My little brother (M21) also lives at home and does the same.\n\nAfter returning from university I noticed that my dad and brother are the laziest people I know when it comes to general house tidiness. They leave shoes and amazon packaging everywhere, pubes on the bathroom floor and sink for over a week (I know it's one of them because of the hair colour), dishes beside the dishwasher, never put the bin out, piss on the toilet seat and never tidy up any spilled food.\n\nIn contrast, maybe somewhat unbelievably, I lived for 4 years at university with various flatmates and our uni flats were by far tidier than at home. Everyone cleaned up after themselves and done their own dishes etc. I'm embarrassed when my girlfriend comes over too because her house is always so tidy and her and her parents are just tidy people.\n\nI've noticed that it is just me and my mum who always seem to be the only ones doing any household chores. My mum, at one point told us all when I was 16 that she needed more help around the house and I feel I'm the only one trying.\n\nI've tried before to tell them to put stuff away and tidy up after themselves but I get \"It's my house! I can leave things wherever I want\" and constantly get shouted down. I'm at the point where I'm getting more and more stressed to the point I'm going to explode soon.\n\nI'm moving out soon and I worry for my mum that when I do she's going to return from work every day and be burdened with all of this more than I know she already is but at the same time she also needs to speak up and make her voice heard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being pissed off at them? \n\nAny advice on how to proceed too would also be appreciated.",

A few days later, I asked my boyfriend, whom I live with, if he wanted to come too. Honestly, I mostly asked him because I was afraid he'd get mad that I was going out that night, which meant we'd only have Saturday night to spend together (he gets upset when we don't spend enough time together).\n\nWhen I asked him, I told him the name of the band, and he said that he'd like to come. I assumed that he would look them up and buy himself a ticket, since I thought that I had made it clear that I already had a ticket with my mom.\n\nThen, tonight, when I brought up the concert again, he got really upset that I hadn't bought a ticket for him, or told him where to buy the tickets. He thought it was really inconsiderate that I hadn't helped him out more with the whole process, and said that it was indicative of the fact that I didn't really want him there. \n\nAITA for assuming that he'd be able to figure out how to get the tickets on his own?",

      "description": "My girlfriend was never one for video games. Still isn't, really. My hobbies were always about computers and video games, and she never really understood it. The only video games she ever played were on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii systems. However, now she has gained interest ever since I finished building my computer.\n\nIt's not that I'm upset with her playing games. I think it's cool she has gained interest, what annoys me is that she will start playing a game that I've already started and will mess up to some regard in game and lose my progress because she doesn't how the game works; and, I'm sorry to say, I don't have much patients to teach people. \n\nI've started her on new games and created new accounts for her, but she insists on playing on my accounts because I have \"more things to do\". I offered to build her a cheaper computer or give her my Xbox, but she refuses... stating that she doesn't like the shooting games and fighting games that I play. \n\nShe has most recently gotten into stardew valley and house flipper. Fun games IMO. Cool. Wonderful. So I walked her through the tutorial phases of those games, and basically let her have her fun. But the annoying part is having her ask every 30 seconds what she has to do next. \"How do I install this sink? How do I paint this wall? How do I tile this floor? Oops I didn't want this, do i have to start over? (All things she's asked from playing the first hour of House Flipper). \n\nOr in stardew she will complain cause she wanted both of us to play the game like we did on consol, but now that I've built my pc idk that I can play 2 player without her having a computer. So I offered to start back on my Xbox, but she doesn't want to. And then she got upset that I started a new game with another friend and we have gotten rather far, and she is mad because it was supposed to he \"our game\". \n\nI love that she wants to get into what I'm into, but she doesn't really have anything of her own... I love being with her, but I wish she could take time to just enjoy something by herself. Learn something new by herself without asking me every 30 seconds how to do something. She is incredibly book smart. She does well in school, but she just doesn't grasp basic concepts in these games. \n\n(Something that transpired while I was writing this: \"Babe I can't paint the corner of the room! The bed is in the way.\" \n\nJump onto the bed - hit space bar.\n\n*hits space bar and jumps where she is standing* \"It doesn't work\".\n\nMove forward and press spacebar.\n*leans over and presses W and Spacebar*\n\n\"Oh... well it didn't work before.\" \n\nYou didn't try it before.\n\n*laughs* \"Yeah you're right.\"\n\n...this girl is nearly 20 years old. Come on.)\n\nI know I need to learn patience, and I love her to death. But I just get annoyed easily when it's something that seems like such a simple concept becomes such a major issue for someone. \n\nAITA for becoming upset at this? I've lost the ability to just play a game by myself basically. I just wish she was contempt with finding a hobby of her own, or at least letting me help her with getting an updated game consol or computer for her to play on. We've talked about getting a switch because it's a simpler format with games she would more enjoy. ",

      "description": "So my brother is having a baby and my fiance and I were having a conversation about going into labor. I mentioned that it is our day and nobody else's. She got super upset saying that it isn't our day, that it was HER day. I was like nah it's not just your day it's both of ours. Then she goes on this rant about how the men don't do anything and how woman can give birth without men and all men are used for is sperm. Then she calls me anti feminist. Wtf? I not once said the man does more in a pregnancy than a woman. I not once said the woman has it easier or anything remotely that makes it sound like the man has equal burden of taking care of the baby into labor. She just went off on me and kept yelling at me about how I don't understand. All I wanted to say that going into labor is a shared experience. I also didn't say going into labor was 50/50 either.. ofc she gotta do more while she's in labor than any male could. Jesus tell me IATA so I can go apologize.",

I didn't because there you will see 60% dicks, 39% horny old men who are looking for young girls and 1% nice ppl. \nThey went on omegle anyway. Honestly, it was really boring to watch them say \"hello sup ok next to another person\" or sometimes a longer conversation but still boring.\nIt continued for 2 hours and I had enough of that shit so I went in my other room to watch some netflix. After they laughed with someone they decided to come to me to see what I'm doing and if I'm okay. I told them to do whatever they want because this night is already ruined and boring. (honestly it sounds like we re 13yo) and that I'm not really mad at them.\nNow I'm just waiting for the morning for them to leave... it's annoying because i could've spend the night in my own room where i feel comfortable and not angry.\nI dont know if its my fault so I could use some help....",

A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying ‘Here are the photos you asked me for’. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn’t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.",

      "description": "My brother has been sick for a few months, and recently asked for my help managing the beurocratic side of things, because with his pain he just didn't have the energy. \n\nI've put a lot of time and energy into lining him up with decent care providers, and dealing with insurance to make sure the services are covered. He has a long road ahead of him, but the doctors are paying off and he is feeling better. He's offered multiple times to pay me for my time, but I know that he has this massive, internalized guilt from our shitty childhood, over feeling like a burden. Its important to me that he knows HE doesn't get to decide when he's a burden on me. Only I get to decide that for myself.\n\nSo I keep refusing payment because a) the burden thing, b) he's my brother and I really don't feel like he owes me anything, and c) even though he's volunteering it, it still feels way too much like extorting a sick person for money. The last time he brought it up, I kinda laughed it off, and said he should just get me something nice for Christmas if he felt like it. \n\nHOWEVER my husband and I are saving for some pretty big life expenses, coming up, and as a result have zero budget for fun, frivolous things. I'm a fountain pen enthusiast, and just found out that a pen I LOVE, that I thought I couldn't buy in the US, can in fact he purchased and shipped to me from a website I just learned about. I want this pen like no other, but absolutely cannot justify spending the roughly $60 (after shipping and taxes). WIBTA for asking my brother to get it for me? I have zero intention of asking for anything else, M- also has a passing interest in fancy pens and wouldn't think it was weird, and I'd be absolutely fine with not getting more than a card or phone call for my birthday/Christmas (we usually spend $30-$60 on each other for each, depending on what games or books the other likes that are out at the time).\n\nI'm wrestling with my own feelings of selfishness and guilt, and would really appreciate judgements from other folks. Am I being to hard on myself, or am I being a frivolous, materialistic asshole?",

      "description": "Some context for our situation, first.\n\nIn total, there are five of us living in this three bedroom house. One of us \\[M27\\] inherited a house after his grandmother passed away, and it has been him and his boyfriend \\[M26\\]. Myself \\[F28\\]. Another friend in the third bedroom \\[M28\\]. The fifth among us \\[M28\\] is a long time friend, someone we care about a great deal. The circumstances of the fifth coming to us was due to difficulty at his parent's where he had been living. He is a very good friend of ours, and we take care of our own. This was in October.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause he didn't have a job, and his money was thin, we didn't ask that he pay rent at first. He stayed on our couch and did dishes for us in return. However, after awhile, the houseowner and his boyfriend started having to buy his food. I usually ate out every night on my own, so the houseowner and his boyfriend paid for most of his food/groceries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe assumed that he would get a job. But time passed, and at the end of January or beginning of February, the house owner eventually told him that he needed to start paying rent like the rest of us beginning March, and to start helping on utilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe got into gear for looking for jobs, and applied everywhere he could after we gave him the deadline. Houseowner and I work at the same place, and we managed to get him an interview there. I drove him to the interview where he wore jeans and a T-shirt, so I had to stop buy him a polo so he'd look presentable. Our manager liked him, but his job history was a stopper on the hiring process going forward, sadly. He had trouble getting other interviews after. I know how hard the job market is, but he's been unemployed for a couple years now. He applied to other places, but the interview I had to buy clothes for him was the only real prospect I am aware of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I brought rent up. I asked if he had the March rent. He said no, that the job market had been hard. I told him that I understood, and gave him to the 5th. I said utilities were due around the 15th. He replied with, \"I'll start packing my things.\" When we all got home, his stuff was gone. We drove by his parents and saw his car there, so we know he's not just sleeping homeless in his car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for enforcing the deadline, KNOWING that he hadn't managed to find a job. But also I feel justified in enforcing it because he 1.) had a month notice and 2) had five months of living with us where he could have gotten a job. I feel horrible because he is our very good friend, but also we sort of feel like we were taken advantage of?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: unemployed roommate lives with us for five months, but does the dishes for us as a thanks. But when unable to meet rent payment deadline we felt forced to set with a month's notice, he vacated the house back to the place he had to leave in the first place.",

      "description": "This happened pretty recently, and me and my friend don't have any hard feelings about it so don't worry about that.\n\nOn occasion, I'll play on Hypixel (Minecraft. Don't judge me) Bed Wars with my friend in a discord call.\n\nFor those who don't know, here's a quick recap of Bed Wars:\n\nIn this mode, there are 16 players all in teams of 2. Each team spawns on a small starting island surrounding a much larger one containing materials for really powerful items. Each team has a bed that they have to protect. If you die normally, you respawn. But if your bed is broken, then you die for good and lose the game. The objective is to break all the other team's beds and finish them off.\n\nMe and my friend hopped into the game and started like normal. After getting some blocks, I decided to rush to team to our left while he (my friend) put blocks over the bed. However, while I'm bridging over to the other team's island, he decides to follow me, rather than doing ANYTHING else that could POSSIBLY be more useful for us. (e.g Protecting the bed more, collecting more materials, etc)\n\nAll this time, I'm repeatedly telling him to stop following me, and that he's not doing anything useful.\n\nWhen I've almost bridged all the way, he jumps the gap and breaks the other team's bed before I even have the chance. Even worse, I fought the other team members, and got them both low on HP. (One of them had about 2 hearts, the other about 6) But after letting me 1v2 this entire team, he swoops in, instantly kills the guy with 2 hearts, and then easily beats the guy with 6 hearts. (He had full HP)\n\nAt this point, I'm fucking pissed. He's literally taken everything I hoped to get by bridging over. Through all of this, he's taken all credit for the bed break and final kills. (A final is a kill on a player that has no bed) Keep in mind, I wasn't trying to boost my final kill or bed break stats by doing that. I was trying to gain experience to level up.\n\nSo, I rage quit.\n\nI left the game, left the discord call, and I can only assume he lost that game, considering I saw him playing No Man's Sky on discord a few minutes later.\n\nAm I the asshole for letting him lose the game because of some in game points?\n\nTL;DR Friend stole my bed break and final kills, and I made him lose the game.",

She confided in me that while medicine was helping and therapy was helping, it was exhausting on her part that it would always need monitoring and could need changing around. This is not a curable condition. This is lifelong. I do not ever want to go through the drama, the back and forth, and the oversharing that happened with her again. I do not want to be put through the emotional ringer every time someone I care about tries to commit suicide or have suicidal gestures. I do not have the emotional energy to be a friend and confidant for someone who is unstable and will be for many times in the future. \n\n\nAs such, if I ever hear that someone has a personality disorder, in particular BPD, I will not pursue any sort of relationship of any sort with them. I won’t be a jerk, but won’t invite them for coffee either. The thing is I’m sure I’ve run into people who have it and haven’t told me... because their treatment is working. AITA for categorically refusing to be friends if they have a certain type of chronic mental illness even if they are currently stable? Should I give them a chance? Can you actually maintain stability with BPD and be symptom and black and white thinking free?",

I have no loans or debts of any kind.\n\nMy brother has 2 kids [10M and 8F] that I love more than anything. Since I have nothing and no one to spend my money on, I spoil them. I buy them expensive stuff like iPhones, iPads, iMacs, branded clothing, and mountains of toys. I take them on holiday all the time. Next summer I’m bringing them to Paris because they want to see the Eiffel Tower. \n\nit’s been brought to my attention that my sister in-law’s parents have a big problem with this. They’re both retired teachers who live very simple lives. It’s their opinion that what I’m doing will make their grandkids into lazy spoiled brats in the future. My nephew told me their grandparents would sometimes say not so nice things about me. \n\nI want to mention that my brother and his wife have absolutely no problem with what I’m doing.  They have never told me to stop. They’re very strict parents so despite me spoiling the kids, they’re not brats. Both of them are polite, respectful, good students and overall really great kids. \n\nSo, AITA if for spoiling my niece and nephew? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "For context she's 24, I'm 26 and we've been dating for 3 years. About 2 weeks ago this guy (let's call him A) she used to be friends with in middle school hit her up on facebook saying he's going to be in our city for a week and would love to meet and catch up and everything. They were good friends till sometime in high school when he moved away and they gradually fell out of touch. Which is totally fine, nothing wrong with that. \n\nThey were originally planning to meet alone till he found out she has a boyfriend and insisted she bring me along saying he wants to meet me too. Anyways we meet and wtf, this guy is incredibly good looking. Like tall, strong jawline, body of one of those guys from fitness magazines kind of good looking. A bit surprising (mainly cus of what she'd told me about him - when they knew each other he was a fat, awkward kid with a funny accent), but again totally fine. Very nice guy, very respectful (not making moves or anything), but I don't know if I could say the same for the gf. Like I said we've been dating for some time so I know her pretty well, and she *very clearly* had the hots for this guy, she'd practically have a \"f\\*\\*\\* me\" face on every time he'd say something to her. Honestly that part kind of hurt because while I know she's attracted to me and our sex life is good, I've never seen her look at me with that kind of lust... To make things worse since that first day we hung out with him she keeps talking about him, I haven't said anything about it cus I know she'll just play it off saying I'm overreacting but yeah, not great. \n\nHe's leaving in a few days so this won't be a problem anymore, but she's said she wants to hang out with him again before he goes... and this time without me. Her justification for it seems to be that I'll get bored + she felt they couldn't catch up very well last time because he was being polite and trying to include me in the conversations so they couldn't really progress past small talk. But just the thought of her going out with him alone, knowing her attraction for him just doesnt sit right with me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I overreacting here? Or is this legitimate reason to worry?",

      "description": "I (18f) had my daughter right after I turned 14. I was in a really dark place. I lost both of my parents at 11, started hurting myself at 12, and my 13 I had anorexia and my periods had stopped, explaining why I didn't think I would get pregnant (as well as some teenage stupidity). Because of these circumstances, I moved in with my brother (28m now) and he financially supported me completely and my daughter (her dad has never been interested but her paternal grandparents do see her often). My brother owns a small business and I helped him out with social media/marketing when I could, as well as cooking.\n\nHowever, my brother fully insisted I go back to school right after having the baby, because I was just starting my GCSEs. I accepted and because he was working from home most of the time, he looked after the baby. Obviously this made him bond with her significantly. When I got home every day I would take over again. During this time I was also recovering from my eating disorder and other mental health issues. My daughter was born prematurely and needed some extra help, so I really did appreciate everything my brother did to help me and I've always done my best to show him that I'm grateful.\n\nAfter finishing school at 16, he again insisted I go back to school to do my A Levels so I could apply to university and basically, in his words, \"not let having a baby so young ruin my life\". I agreed after some persuasion and started sixth form, and our arrangement continued but I had free periods that I could come home early from or go in late for, so I got the chance to help out more. \n\nNow, I'm 18 and applying to uni. My daughter has started school recently so my brother gets more time to himself. Now that I have applied to uni, I'm planning on moving out with my daughter into a small apartment with a couple of my friends, who are a couple and also have a baby, and my boyfriend. I expected my brother would be happy because his business is getting bigger and this gives him chance to work more. However when I told him, he was distraught, saying that he thinks of her like his own daughter and can't stand the idea of being away from her (the uni I'm planning on going to is a 40 minute drive away - not far but not close enough to see her every day - also her school is halfway between, so she won't have to move school). I understood but I don't know what he wants me to do. She is my daughter and I want her to be with me, especially now that I am able to take care of her, but I understand that my brother has more money than me and she is used to living in that place. I don't know what to do. \n\nI want to clarify that I do have enough money to look after her and I am a capable mother, but I know my brother could do just as good of a job. I'm not really considering leaving her with him, but I want to know if it makes me an asshole to not.",

      "description": "US. Throwaway. It snowed heavily last night and when we were on the interstate this morning there was still a lot of slush. On unplowed neighborhood roads, there was a lot of snow and it took him a lot longer to stop than he expected. Like, he ended up in the middle of the intersection on a four way stop (fortunately no other cars around)\n\nIt's pretty well known in my group that I have anxiety about cars and traffic. In these road conditions, we could see cars that had slipped on turns and ended up in the middle of the opposing lane and stuff, so I was already concerned and on edge. Visibility was poor. \n\nI really try not to overly backseat drive, but I saw that we were whizzing past cars in the right lane (did you know that cars going significantly different speeds is a leading cause of fatal accidents?) and I glanced at the speedometer (I was in the seat behind him, not the passengers seat) and found that he was going just over 90mph. In those conditions. Very illegal, very dangerous.\n\n\"You have to slow down,\" I said.\n\nHe said something about it not being a big deal, so I just said, \"fine, I'll just be quiet then.\" And silently stewed in my panic the rest of the way.

This was a very hard thing for her to do, as she is a very private person in this regard, but the photos are amazing and my wife is absolutely gorgeous on them.\n\nYesterday night, as we were looking through the photos, she mentioned that the photographer asked her again whether she could add some of those photos to her portfolio (my wife has initially asked the photographer to not use her photos for portfolio).\n\nI have suggested that perhaps, she could allow the photographer to use some of the faceless photos, where her head and face are not visible. In some of those faceless photos, she is only wearing panties and is topless.\n\nMy wife became very angry with me, and still is, and said that if I am prepared to share photos of her body all over the interned, I do not deserve to have such photos at all. I however see things differently. Firstly the photos are anonymous and they would be in a portfolio of a photographer, and with the abundance of erotic and porn on the interned, I very much doubt that these photos would be used for much else, than to be viewed by prospective clients, and again with them being completely anonymous I would no be too phased (despite being quite a jealous person normally).\n\nIs my way of thinking wring and am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Some backstory: I dated a girl back in 2016, let's call her A. We lived together fairly early on, and shared an apartment with my sister and her girlfriend. My sister and A got along well, but as far as I knew weren't best friends. Generally, my relationship with A was rocky. I had just come out as lesbian and this was my first actual relationship with a woman. Looking back, I realize that I was so excited to explore my newfound sexuality that I settled for the first woman that seemed interested in me, and that was definitely wrong of me to do. We moved in together out of necessity (her mother, who she previously lived with, skipped town and left her homeless). I went to school and had a job and it seemed like she didn't want to much other than watch TV, play video games, and stay at home. I felt like I had more of a lazy friend than a girlfriend. It isn't a relationship I look back on fondly. After about 9 or so months together, I decided it wasn't the relationship for me, I wasn't happy in the slightest, and it wasn't going to work out. I broke up with her, and she moved out of the apartment and to a different city about 2.5 hrs away. She would text me occasionally, making sure I definitely wanted to break up. I definitely did. Eventually, I blocked her. I thought that was that. \n\nFast forward to a couple months ago. I get a message from my sister asking if my current girlfriend and I would come to a 20-person surprise party she was planning on throwing for her fiancee in March. I say of course, count us in. After all is said and done, I get another message: \"Don't h8 me but A is invited too\". I was a little blindsided by this message, as I wasn't really aware that they were still in contact after A and I's relationship was over. I replied \"If you want her there, that's your decision. But my decision is that I'm not comfortable going if she goes. It makes me uncomfortable, and it's a weird situation altogether for both me and J (my current girlfriend).\"\n\nNow, I didn't mind not going to this surprise party. However, she then told me that I was going to have to get over it, because A is coming to her wedding (happening this summer) as well. The wedding is also going to be small, about 50 people so they can convey an \"intimate feel\". I feel I'm put in a bad predicament here. On one hand, I don't want to upset my sister and demand that she change her guest list so that I can feel comfortable. But, I want to be able to have fun. I also don't want to cause any sort of drama with my current girlfriend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA for making a deal about my ex-girlfriend coming to my sister's wedding?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any extra info is needed, lemme know.

      "description": "As you can guess with the jeepneys and tricycle, I'm from the philippines. There is currently a serial killer freely walking around our city and most of the killings happened in my SO's area. I want her to go straight home from school which will cause a bit more money than having to take a jeepney and take a short walk. Not just she prefers the latter, she aggressively insists it. However, the situation is more subjective and personal than you guys might think. It is currently exam day and I wasn't able to attend due to my sickness. This had an impact on her, as we were supposed to help each other before the exam and the company of me being there would have been great to her. We discussed how she would go home through text. She got mad at me for a lot of things and for the difficult situation she's faced to, with me not being there and all. But it was mainly because I kept insisting her to go straight home through riding a tricycle which will cause a little more money as compared to taking a jeepney with her friends and take a short walk alone. I think that she behaved that way because she has plans to spend her money on me for a different occasion but I'm not entirely certain. I behaved that way because a decent number of killings happened in her area. I want her to be safe. With me insisting she should take the safer way home, we got into an arguement. She told me that I don't trust her enough and that I assumed the worst case scenario would happen, which is her becoming a victim of the killer. I told her to think about if we switched places. She didn't take that very good. Me comparing her to me backfired. She kept telling me she'd wanna die of an accident or something just to stop me from \"assuming the worst case scenario to happen\" which i didnt assume at all. This made me more inclined to have it her way, but I really just want her to be safe. She's more troubled than I might be able to express in this post as she is faced to an undesirable situation. In the last part of our fights, she tells me that I am way too controlling and she wants to end the relationship, despite me submitting to her decision to take the jeepney and admitting that I was too controlling.\n\nMaking this post for me is more like getting the load off my chest rather than asking AITA, but I would appreciate any opinions.",

And he has opened up to me many times about this over the last couple of years \n\nA little context on me now, I have a twin sister that went to the same school as me and often I was bullied at school and a common subject that would come up was that I fancied my sister (which obviously wasn’t true) and other shit that often really pissed me off. \n\n(Btw, I’m not comparing my situation to his I’m just providing background)\n\nCut to 2017 and it was the last year of school. We were fairly close friends with very similar friends but recently I had introduced him to some new friends of mine that went to another school.  This new friends obviously didn’t know Luke very well but they got along.\n\nOne night I was on discord with Luke and one of my new friends. Luke was chatting shit about me and my sister and I had had enough saying how I could really piss him off but I wouldn’t say it cause it was too mean. So I pmed the new friend saying that what I would say would be chatting shit about his mum. But of course I would never say that because it would completely undo the friendship with him as it is a very sensitive subject for him.\n\nLuke starts dared me to say what I was going to say, calling me a pussy and shit. After I few seconds the new friend says “He was going to say something about your Mum.”\n\nImmediately, Luke leave the discord and starts messaging me saying, “wtf is wrong with you” and “I’m going to tell everybody that you love shoving spoons up your ass” (seriously, that what he threatened me with). So i try to explain what actually happened, how I never actually said anything.\n\nHe starts messaging my new and old friends saying how I love shoving spoons up my ass. Naturally I get pissed off and unfriend him on Facebook and other social medias. \n\nI’ve again to message my mate Liam (fake name) and I tell him what’s happened and that it’s pissed me off and I sent him this video https://youtu.be/S-eBHDT9fI4 saying “can you imagine if I sent this to him”, (which obviously didn’t send).\n\nThat weekend my mate Liam had a small house party with a few of our mates and he invite me and Luke, I say I can’t go and Luke ends up going and stays the night . Luke ends up reading Liam’s messages I send him and presumably sees the video. I guess this enraged him cause he made sure that the last month or so of school was shit for me.\n\nHe made a lot of my friends turn on me and he would start chatting shit to me at school and in return I would talk to him in the most condescending, passive aggressive tone that really pissed him off. \n\nNow in saying all this, I wanted us to be friends or at least acquaintances by the end of the year but that proved not possible as he wasn’t willing to talk about it, it was only only until we were completely wasted that we could talk about it but it seems we are back to square one.\n\nSo what do you guys think, am I an asshole for not confronting him and apologising about it?",

Most of us are either in North America or Canada, but we have one friend in the Netherlands. Because I'm on the West Coast and the Canadians are closer to that side of Canada, it can be really hard to find time to game/hang out with him outside of our weekly DnD game, especially when the rest of us can usually find a night or two to get together after normal working hours during the week. What often happens is that he'll end up pinging our discord server on Saturday morning as that's when most of us are free and asking who is around to play and sometimes can be insistent. Not in a cruel way, just a \"When can you play?\" as opposed to a \"Can you play?\"\n\nHe's a really nice guy and not in a \"Nice Guy\" type way, but a genuine friendly dude way and I really like him, but I work all week and sometimes just want to have my Saturday mornings to listen to podcasts and play some single player games/hang with my cat as opposed to having to be \"on\" Discord cracking jokes. This leads to me sometimes not responding/saying I'm busy when I just really want to have my Saturday morning to myself.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give up my Saturday mornings to game with my buddy?

      "description": "Context: I (24f) got out of a 4 year relationship a year and a half ago. It was a bad relationship, I won't get into all of it, but my ex was bipolar and an alcoholic and dealt with a lot of legal troubles throughout the relationship (4 months in prison and then another 2 or 3 years of supervised probation.) I had to help him with more than I was ever comfortable with. It caused almost constant stress in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after I ended that relationship, I started seeing this guy, \"M\" (24.) I told him right away that I didn't want anything serious, but we've been hooking up/hanging out for over a year now. I know that M likes me a lot and might want something more serious. I should also note that at this point we are more than just \"fuck buddies,\" I really like him as a person, we text throughout the week and he's someone I feel comfortable being around when I'm upset/stressed/whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately M has been going through a lot. He broke down crying in front of me last week. He got a DUI years ago and is still dealing with the repercussions, and a lot of his behavior reminds me of my ex (avoiding and ignoring problems but constantly worrying about what will happen when those problems catch up with him. Not taking the appropriate actions to fix things.) He said he's at risk of going to jail. I helped him with some things, helped him buy a new battery for his car, let him use my phone, bought him food, gave him some rides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to feel like it's too much. I don't want to hear about his issues; it's in my nature to want to help in whatever way I can but I don't want to put myself in that situation. I REALLY care about this guy, genuinely want to see him be ok. So I feel awful for not wanting anything to do with him if he's going to be going through all of this. I also think it's important to note that the biggest thing I have an issue with is him relying on me emotionally. When he was crying I felt exactly like I did in my last relationship. I felt awful for him but helpless and sort of resentful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'll just gradually back off and if he asks, tell him I've been busy with work (which is true) and focusing on myself. I don't know if it would be better to be honest in this situation and tell him I can't be a part of his life while he's dealing with so much. I know I get to choose who I want in my life but I feel like a huge asshole for wanting to be done with this friendship/relationship at the exact moment M probably needs me most. It's not like I'm his girlfriend, it doesn't directly impact my day to day life, so should I just suck it up, be a good friend and help him through it even though it makes me uncomfortable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr I want to cut contact with a guy I've been seeing for awhile because he's been dealing with legal troubles, money troubles etc. and leaning on me for emotional support and it reminds me of a shitty past relationship.

      "description": "This all happened just a couple of days ago. Just to preface the story, I live in a small, older house on the local university campus. I live with three other roommates who I have known for quite some time. Our house has a small driveway that fits four cars if its completely full; every person living here has a car. The driveway has been a topic of conversation for me and one of the other roommates for some time. I should mention that two people live upstairs (me and A) and two people live downstairs (S and E). S and E are a couple. Okay... now on to the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I get home from work normal time, around 6:00 PM. I usually just park on the street, but tonight there was no parking because there was a basketball game going on right down the road, so I decided to park in the driveway. There were already three cars in the driveway, S's second car that is broken down and a random car that I assumed was a friend of S or E. E was also parked in the driveway. I go inside and don't think anything of it. Another friend of mine, lets call them C, calls and says they are coming over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nC arrives shortly after and comes upstairs. C says he parked in the driveway, so E must have left. A and I decide that he should stay there as two of the spots are already taken by cars that belong to the downstairs. After a while E gets home and calls me asking for a parking pass. We give her one and she heads back out to her car. A few minutes later I get a call from E asking if she can swap cars with C for a minute to unload some stuff from her car. There was no where on the street for C to swap, but C, A, and I offered to help E bring her things downstairs. She said no thanks and hung up the phone. I thought we were done there but I got another call just a few minutes later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE called again but this time she said she had to \"pull this card\" and it was her driveway and C needed to move. I told E that the spots allotted to downstairs were full and that C was not going to move. E ended up getting very upset and called S, getting him involved in the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, S came home with his friend and they moved their car. E ended up with a spot in the driveway but  E and S are both still very angry, saying that I was disrespectful and that E was entitled to a spot in the driveway. I see where they are coming from, but I feel like the fact that the two spots for the downstairs were taken kind of voids their argument. I just want some non-biased feedback.   \n\n\nAITA???",

It’s like an 11 hour trip. And though it would be nice to spend some time in the backseats with the kids, I honestly don’t want to do it for  11 hours both ways. I end up feeling like a child myself. Or a nanny. It’s difficult to even be part of the “adult” conversations up front 😂 Even saying that makes me feel like such a child. But it’s not only that. I don’t want to be on someone else’s schedule. That means we get up and go whenever the hell his dad decides. Then being without our own transportation for the weekend. Not like it’s a big deal to borrow someone’s car, but it’s just another element I don’t like. The entire thing just irks me. I almost want to tell him he can carpool with daddy. I’ll drive down with one of the kids. ",

      "description": "My spouse is leaving on a trip at about 4:00 in the morning. I offered to drive him to the airport if he didn’t want to leave his car there during the trip. But he does want to park his car there. So I wasn’t planning to drive him, clearly. The airport is about 20 minutes away, one way. It’s not a large airport. Tonight he said he wants me to drive in a separate car and stand by his luggage at the curb while he parks his car so that he doesn’t have to park, go in and get a wheeled cart for the luggage, and then walk back out to the car. One of his bags is heavy. \n\nIt would take 10 minutes for him to walk in, get a cart, go back to the car, and walk in with the luggage. It would take me about 45 minutes for me to drive to the airport, stand there while he parks the car and walks in, and then drive back home. At 4 am. \n\nHe’s really mad at me for not wanting to do this. AITA?",

      "description": "My ex girlfriend gave birth to our daughter when I was 15 and she was 16. Throughout her pregnancy, she was extremely abusive to me. On three different occasions, she stabbed me with a knife, and on many more with forks, earrings, anything really. She punched, kicked, scratched etc, for reasons as small as me looking at my phone for more than 20 seconds without looking at her. She was also verbally abusive, and at one point, she threw a shoe at my dog. At 15 and with her being pregnant, I didn't want to leave her in fear of her not letting me see our kid. She was harming herself at the time and always said that if I left her, she'd go straight to the police and say it was me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, after our daughter was born she had a complete mental breakdown (another reason I stayed with her and didn't report any of this is because she is diagnosed with schizophrenia) and was hospitalised. My mom and I took full custody of my daughter and my ex showed no sign of wanting to be in her life for five years. At this point, I am 20 and still suffering from what she did. I have regular panic attacks and night terrors, and have been seeing a therapist all this time. Recently, my ex contacted my mom in a very blunt and demanding way asking for contact with our daughter, despite calling her a \"mistake\" and \"failed abortion\" to an ex mutual friend within the past year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get that my ex might somehow have changed and become a better person, but I don't want her alone with my daughter. On the other hand, I couldn't stand to be in a room with her without panicking and the same goes for my mom, who also faced a torrent of verbal abuse and threats from her in the past. So basically, I don't see a way for this to work unless I let my daughter be on her own with my ex, which I don't want to do at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR am I wrong for not wanting my abusive ex to have contact with our daughter?",

Last Friday, around 1pm, we get the expected “you guys coming over?” text from H. J and I respond saying we will around 8pm when H gets off work. \n\nAround 6pm, another friend tells us he has a bunch of free tickets to a local show. Naturally J and I say we wanna go. So we text H and tell him about the show, thinking he’d wanna go. H replies, saying he doesn’t want to. After some discussion, J and I decide we’re going anyway. So we text H that we’re going, and obviously he is more than welcome to come. The show didn’t start until after he got off at 8, so we could still meet up and go to the show. \n\nTo our surprise, H starts blowing up our phones with some pretty shitty messages. I’ll spare the more intense parts, but he essentially said he doesn’t wanna hangout with us again. We apologized, and went on with our night. He hasn’t spoken to us since.\n\n\nI feel it’s important to note that there have been several occasions when H wanted to do something, and J and I bit the bullet and did whatever H wanted to do, because yaknow that’s just kinda what friends do. \n\nSo AITA? \n\n",

It turns out my hair becomes very curly once it gets to a certain length.\n\nI'm no model or anything, so I'm not claiming that, but I get WAY more attention from girls now, or at least, they approach me more? I've had a few girls approach me in nightclub settings/parties saying ''Wow I love your hair'' and then we escalate from there.\n\nBut I've also had some girls who just touch my hair without permission. This ONLY happens in nightclub/party settings, but it happened ONCE during daylight hours. \n\nAnyway, I was at a party recently socializing and having a good time and I went to pour myself another drink, and out of nowhere I feel someone touch my hair. I turn around and I see a girl smiling, so I just calmly look her in the eye and say ''Get the fuck off me, and do NOT do that again''. I looked very stern when I said that and she looked really scared now (also if it makes any difference, she was about 5''4 while I am 6''2 so I'm a bit bigger than her). \n\nOne of my friends said this was a major asshole thing to say someone AITA?",

I heard him talk about his girlfriend before but it had been a while and I assumed he broke up with her. When I found out he didn’t, I still stayed. I’m not in the best headspace and I wanted someone to care about me.\n\nFinally, the guilt got too much and I tried to break it off. He told me that he was going to break up with her, he loved me more, etc and like a moron I believed him. Then once my guilt manifested into not being able to have sex with him he broke it off, never having broken up with her.\n\nFast forward to now, I am a wreck. I can’t sleep, every time I see him I want to vomit, he told all my personal stuff to our mutual friends on campus and now I have no one. I found his girlfriend on Instagram and I am thinking of telling her. “The truth will set you free” and all that. I want to put this behind me, I’m just worried about my motivations. A part of me does want revenge, but i mostly just want to stop punishing myself on her behalf and let her do it herself. Or she forgives me.\n(Note: I’m not going to tell her anything along the lines of “oh I feel so guilty pls forgive me” I just planned on telling her he cheated and I’m sorry she had to hear it from me. Maybe say I came to her because the guilt got too much just so she doesn’t think I’m doing it maliciously)\n\nSo, render your judgement reddit. Will I be the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for speaking up about my eldest sisters husband trying to solicit sexual favours from me when I was 13*",
      "description": "*I am now 21\n\nThis year I essentially destroyed (my mother’s words) my family by speaking up about my eldest sisters husband trying to solicit sexual favours from me on Christmas Day when I was 13, while everyone else was in their post Christmas feast coma (and didn’t speak up at the time as I was told by him no one would believe me because I was 13 and he was 28 and “who would believe a child over an adult”).\n\nI hated Christmas before this incident because my family always had the tendency to (literally) scream at each other over anything whenever they were forced to occupy the same house, but this incident only made me despise the holidays more.\n\nI spoke up about this in August, because in April I was told that I would be required to drive 8 hours (one way) to spend a week at said eldest sisters house because “that’s what everyone is doing for Christmas” and was told that it didn’t matter what “excuses” I had as my attendance wasn’t “optional”. I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, “had to be making everything up to destroy her life when she’s finally happy”, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can “attempt” to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn’t lying, and that I didn’t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn’t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I’m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I’ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to “make this all go away or pick a side”, to which my mother replied that she couldn’t make it go away and that she wouldn’t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that “family will always be there for you and protect you”, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I’m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I’M the monster for trying to protect them because I’m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don’t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.",

I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who’s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don’t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I’m not against him staying the night I just don’t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don’t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??",

      "description": "I am a college freshman going to school in the Northeast. I dropped the ball on my roommate-pairing application process (as did my former roommate, let's call him William) and we got paired together despite our obvious differences. Our first meeting and the first week or so went well. I learned he had never shared a room with anyone before and that he wished he'd gotten into a better school than this one. Great, I thought.. this was my reach school. One thing that was off was that he seemed sort of awkward around me, never initiating conversations or making eye contact. \n\nI'm fairly untidy, and while my mess never crossed to his half of the room, it still looked bad in comparison to his neatly arranged textbooks and perfectly made bed. William woke up at 6:00 every morning while I generally got up around 7:00-7:30. He spent a lot of time studying whereas I spent much of my time playing videogames (with headphones.) He went to bed around 9:30-10:00, and if I was in the dorm at that time I'd either go to sleep too, or move to the dorm's communal lounge area.\n\nProblems didn't really begin until my girlfriend started to visit on weekends. The first two times she visited, it was a last minute decision &amp; I didn't give William a lot of advance notice that she would be coming over. August 31st, I gave him about an hour, and September 7th, about a day's notice. However, both times I was very clear that if he's not comfortable with her being around that she can sleep downstairs in the lounge, but he said he had a friend he could stay with and that it would be fine. Alright, cool. After that, I gave him between 5-8 days of heads-up &amp; she came over three more times over a span of 2 months or so. Despite the fact that things had been fine between us (although he had been just as awkward &amp; silent as usual,) I started hearing through mutual friends that he had been complaining about me to them. Now, I don't mind that he had complaints about me, but it really frustrated me that rather than tell me that something I was doing bothered him, he would complain about me to our mutual friends. It was stuff like how I came back to the dorm late at night sometimes, or how my half of the room was messy, or about how I didn't give him advance notice earlier in the semester. So I oiled my bed-springs to make 'em quieter and even made my bed (once.)\n\nThen, without warning, William moved out on October 30th to another dorm. That evening I sent him a text saying \"Hey, I'm sorry things didn't work out. I genuinely hope your new room/roommate is more to your liking and the rest of your year goes well.\" No reply. Since then, he has never spoken to me in person or otherwise..\n\nAm I the asshole, Reddit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My wife’s always wanted braces, her teeth aren’t fucked up beyond belief, there’s just some crowding on the top row that isn’t horrible but impacts her confidence in her smile.\n\nShe has a child, a 10 year old, she claims on her taxes. We file separately for a multitude of reasons but she gets the tax break for the kiddo. He isn’t mine by blood but my income goes to support him too. The one time I brought up that I was entitled to a piece of her refund she lost her shit and said SHE got the tax break for having a kid, at which point I corrected her and said no, you get it for SUPPORTING him, not just for having him, and I support him just as much as you do. She apologized and said I was right and she was wrong, I told her not to worry about it for now.\n\nIn January we discussed braces for her. She’s always wanted them, always been fucked financially and could never use her tax refund as a down payment because of shitty financial decisions of her ex. I was expecting her to get about $1000 more back in federal than she did. I wanted to put $2500 down and finance the rest and double up on payments to get them paid off quicker. Well, I’m not dipping into savings for fucking braces, so we’re only putting $1500 down.\n\nWell, last night we got into a minor fight when I told her it was kinda selfish to get braces when we could be buying a house instead. She compared me to her ex and said I was just another guy telling her no and that she’d take her refund out of our shared account and put it in her own. I told her it was a $163/month investment and I was putting the onus on her to offset the cost. We sat down and figured out that by prepping our lunches for work we’d save close to $200/month. We took it a step further and figured out a few other small changes we could make and suddenly we’re saving closer to $300/month.\n\nAt the end of the day I’m okay with her investing in something she’s always wanted to do, but I still can’t help but feel like it’s a selfish decision. Her reasoning of “well we paid all of our revolving debt off! We can afford this!” Is bullshit imo. When a debt is paid off, you shouldn’t just acquire more fucking debt.\n\nTLDR: am I an asshole for being kinda pissed my wife is spending $5800 on braces rather than saving the money and buying a house in the next 10 months?",

The owner has decided to sell the condo so I'm going to look into purchasing a house as I no longer want to rent and want to build equity.                    \n\nThe realty company that manages the condo I live in have of course offered to represent me in buying a home. However, a few months ago in December I failed to pay rent. I don't know how it happened. Whether I didn't navigate all the way to the payment page online or if it just skipped my mind completely. But its the first time its ever happened. I've never been late in the past 4 years and infact, 99% of the time pay my rent 1-2 weeks early.                         \n\nWhile it is entirely on me for forgetting to pay, I feel that after 4 years of early payment and being very understanding when needing repairs (they aren't timely when I've needed maintenance.) that I deserve some kind of heads up before they take legal action. So on the 5th of December I find a 5 days to pay or vacate document taped to my front door. So of course I paid immediately and also had to pay $50 to cover their legal fees.                \n\nA simple phone call or email would have been nice instead of immediately trying to evict me.              \n\nKnowing that the realtor fee is 6% of home price and in my market will amount to about $10,000 I don't want to give them that money.              \n\nAm I just being petty?

Problem is she lives with her long-term boyfriend and Jack just wasn't into her, so end of story right? Well recently Jack revealed to me he reciprocated those feelings, and on top of that, the two of them were planning on going on a week long vacation in Cancun. They claimed they weren't going to do anything physical and that a relationship was a possibility months down the road but not now. \n\nThen a week ago, Amy wanted to talk to me, and asked me what I thought about J&amp;A relationship. I told her that if I were in her position, I would tell her bf about her feelings and that she liked Jack. Basically that bf deserves the whole truth since Jack is actually friends with the bf and hangs out at their place A LOT, and that she's emotionally cheating on him. She tells me that she was already planning on breaking up with bf for reasons unrelated to Jack, but when I specifically ask her if Jack was a factor in her decision now, she confirms that he is. So I guess she took our convo to heart, broke up with bf and told him the truth. Cool. But not really?? \n\n Cuz a couple of days ago, Jack asks to talk to me over lunch and asks me what I thought about the two of them. I tell him that it was good of Amy to be honest with ex-bf and Jack just BLOWS UP. We're out at a cafe and Jack starts yelling at me for making Amy cry (after our convo), not acting happy for their relationship, and that ex-bf didn't need to know everything cuz \"she was going to break up with him anyways\". I get pissed because I didn't force her to do anything, just told her that what I would do in her position and that ex-bf deserves to know that Amy was planning on getting with Jack. He calls me cruel for wanting to hurt her ex-bf?? And that I was controlling for saying I'd want the whole truth in my relationship??\n\nI didn't want to be involved, but they asked me my thoughts. If they had asked if I would be supportive, then I would've just said yes. \n\nSo AITA??",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to go to gay pride?",
      "description": "About an hour ago I had a full blown argument with my girlfriend regarding pride and other LGBT community events. \n\nI guess I should start by saying I am, by no means, homophobic. I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. ",

      "description": "This happened ten years ago. But although I don't dwell on it, I do sometimes wonder if I was the asshole or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife and I, married 17 years, had agreed early in our marriage that the only gifts we would exchange were on birthdays and Christmas. On our wedding anniversary, Valentines day, mothers/fathers day we would give a card. Of course we often gave each other spontaneous gifts at any time of the year, but we were just trying to avoid some of the more egregious \"Hallmark Holiday\" obligations. We preferred to give gifts when we felt like it, rather than when we were told to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 17 years and we had been having a lot of friction and tension in our marriage. No-one had done anything hurtful or bad, but we were working too hard at our careers and didn't put enough effort into our relationship. Nothing major but there was a lot of bickering and even some nasty no-holds-barred fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith our anniversary coming up I decided to try to reset the clock and do something nice. Over a couple of months I trawled through old hard drives and memory cards and assembled a collection of photographs starting from when we met, up to the present day. It included scanning photos from the pre-digital era. I then printed around 200 images that I felt were a nice record of our life together. Lots of shots of us in love, the arrival and growth of our children, Christmases and vacations down through the years, that sort of thing. I bought a presentation album and mounted the photos. I was certain she would love it and it would help us to remember the good things that we had achieved during our time as a couple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I had not given any thought to the long-standing \"no anniversary gifts\" practice. I couldn't see it at the time, but I'm sure you can see where this is going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the day I presented it to her in bed along with a card declaring my continued love and commitment. She flipped out and after looking at one page refused to look any further. She was as angry as I have seen her and the thrust of her anger was that I had only done this \"to make her feel bad for not getting me anything.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I the asshole for embarrassing her with a sentimental gift when she had nothing to give me?",

Now I'm pretty introverted and I will admit I have an anger problem that is slowly coming under control. Now onto the scenario.\n\nSo this happened like last week, I was sitting in the commons where the gaming club meets, and I was studying for an exam coming up in a couple hours, when a girl who is part of the club walks up, being loud as all hell. She goes to play Smash Ultimate since someone brought a Switch, they start talking about Mary Poppins, that new one that came out. So I put my headphones in and start playing Powerwolf and Sabaton to drown them out. Turns out the loud girl starts belting out songs from Mary Poppins, loud enough to be heard over Powerwolf and there were other people studying there besides me. I didn't do anything but my anger did start to flare up. Now would I have been the asshole to tell her to be quiet and stop singing cause people are trying to study and irk the anger of her and the rest of the club?\n\nTL;DR Girl sings too loudly, allowing her to be heard over blaring metal while people are studying",

His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship.

      "description": "Hello everyone this is my first post on this subreddit also English is not my native language so sorry for bad grammar.\n\nSo this happen today at school my class, my friend class and my best friend class were send to a large group room were we needed to sit for 3 and half hours while the 12th graders took some test or something while we were there I heard my friend calling me over to her place but at the same time I see my best friend who I saw with a group of friends talking so I thought to myself that she be find without me over there now my friend and my best friend don't like seeing each other eye to eye so it kind of got harder for me to share with my friend as my best friend always want to spend more time with me, but today I decided to hang out with my friend and it was a lot of fun. Later that day I was waiting for my best friend to get out of her math class when suddenly she gave me this look of discussed and starter telling me that I was a asshole because I didn't hang out with her I clearly told her that she was with her group of friends and I was with mine. She then decided to stop talking to me and giving me dirty looks. Am I really the asshole \n\nPs: I know this is not that excited from other stories from this subreddit but it be really helpful to see if I or her was in the wrong.\n\n\n",

      "description": "So okay, my girlfriend (19f) is very insecure about her breasts because they are fairly small. I have told her many times I don’t care about that and that I think she is beautiful. A while ago she told me that she might want to do implants, but then later said that she doesn’t and that she just want to try to accept herself for how she is.\n\nHowever, last week we were talking about buying new clothes etc when she mentions how a lot of tops are kind of “big” at the top and smaller at the bottom or something like that. She then asks like: what can I do to make the clothes fit better? So I joke to her: get your breast implants! This joke did not land well however, and she got extremely upset. \n\nShe told me I’m basically in inconsiderate asshole for joking about something that I know makes her feel very bad about herself, and that she is very insecure about. I told her I was sorry and that it was just a joke, but she could really not forgive me for it I guess. She is still mad. I’m just wondering if I’m really the asshole, or if she is just overreacting. Please do tell me haha.",

      "description": "So this happened roughly 2 months ago, my father is an epileptic who had just had his medication changed and was having dinner with my younger brother (15) at a restaurant when he had a seizure about 2 minutes before getting in the truck and driving my brother home (which would've caused an accident) \n\nMy mother was away on a trip so my brother called me after he called the ambulance, but as I live an hour away I called my grandparents (who usually have no say in things like these) to check if my brother was okay.\n\nMy dad usually denies having epilepsy as a real problem as he was born into the generation of men where anything mental is considered weakness, so my brother knows from experience to force my dad to go to hospital. My grandparents arrived about 5mins before the ambulance did and when they got there they told my brother that my dad wasn't going to hospital even though he tried telling them he needed to go. My grandparents didn't let my brother talk to the ambulance staff and made him wait in the rain while they told them that my dad wasn't going to hospital.\n\nWhen I arrived I got in an argument with them and eventually told them to fuck off because they refused to let my dad go in the ambulance and took him home. \n\nI feel really bad because my grandparents are 80, usually the nicest people and have been friendly for the longest time but because they sided with my dad he didn't go to hospital and they usually have no say in things like this. \n \nSide note: He had a seizure while driving about 3 weeks later, which I believe was directly caused by him not going to hospital and changing his medication back which made him break 2 ribs and have a heavy concussion\n\n",

My wife thinks I may have Aspergers and this is probably why I act like I do but I tend to not want to be with people that I view as my co workers since I feel like they are just that.....co workers, nothing more. \n\nThere are some that try to make an attempt to be my friend but they are far and few and I don't mind these people but others like, a certain dept I have to sit next to, annoys me to no end. \n\nI'm not saying they are bad people, no. I just don't like them because they are constantly talking about things that are of no interest to me. To be blunt, I go to work to do my job, get a paycheck, and go home. I don't really care about the relationships in the workplace other than, the ones they talk about with the whole, don't burn bridges thing.\n\nI tend to keep to myself and stay quiet unless I'm needed since they never seem interested in my convos or understand what I'm talking about since we are from two totally different worlds. \n\nI make small efforts to connect with them but lately I stopped since I feel like it's not worth it and they hit me with what I was wondering about today.....AITA in this?\n\nThey asked me why I'm so reserved and why I generally don't like going to company events, outings, etc... or why I don't donate things like PTO to a coworker I don't like (keep in mind they don't exactly know who I like or don't like, I'm neutral to everyone in their minds) or money/food for birthday parties at the office. \n\nTruth is, I don't want them to throw events for me, or give me anything other than my paycheck. I don't care much about them other than making sure they are working with my systems and my systems are performing at their best. When it comes to my job, I don't care how well they do their jobs, all I care about is my systems are working like they should, sending emails, processing data, connecting to the internet, etc.... but how well the worker does their job, or how long they have to stay afterhours is of no importance to me. I will try to actively make their lives easier with scripts, updates, and such that help them improve their productivity and mood towards my machines but other than that, I don't care at all about their feelings, their days, nothing. \n\nThe bosses don't think much of it but the workers are concerned that I never participate or donate food, money, or time to their gifts, outings, etc... I don't go to them and I don't eat any of their food, nothing. I've always felt that my money and such is my business and I fully intend to use it to invest in myself and my family. I don't care if they starve, I only care if my family starves. \n\nThey're wondering why I'm so detached from them and I'm not mean about it, only quiet and reserved. \n\nThat job is just that...a job.

      "description": "Long story short: we have 6 backyard chickens that can hop out 4 foot fence and spend time eating all the bugs in my neighbors’ yards and pooping. I have tried clipping their wings and making our fence taller with tree branches so they can’t hop to the top railing and hop down, but neither options has worked. I get that ITA for that, but for the moment there’s nothing I can do. We can’t find anyone to take them. My husband works 60 hours/week, and I work full time at night and go to school full time during the day, not to mention it’s cold and rainy bc winter, so building an enclosed run hasn’t been a feasible option. \n\nWe’ve talked to neighbors on either side, across the street, and 2 doors down to explain our situation, apologize, and offered to power wash sidewalks of poop stains/give them free eggs once production picks back up in the spring—WHILE working on a solution. A chicken run is just a big expensive project, and will take some time to save up for/build. They were all pretty nice and understanding, especially once we offered to clean up the sidewalks and told them that the chickens will eat all the fleas and mosquitos in the yard (we live in the south and it’s a problem). \n\nMy question is this: our neighbor 3 doors down left a vaguely threatening letter on our porch on Christmas Eve. He is claiming that our chickens have destroyed his flower beds (it’s the dead of winter, but I can’t see where the damage is) and that if we don’t find a way to keep them in our yard, he’s going to sue us or kill our chickens. I get his frustration, and at this moment he doesn’t know that we HAVE tried to contain the chickens....but I’m writing him a letter back. He won’t answer the door the few times I’ve gone down there to talk to him like a polite adult. AITA if I tell him what we told our other neighbors (we’ve tried containing the chickens, bear with us, were working on it, we’ll power wash your sidewalks and give you free eggs) and ask him not to leave threatening letters on our porch ever again?

I was annoyed, but being passive aggressive but up a plastic chicken wire fence to stop the dog from coming into and pooping in my yard proper. They often let their dog roam around the neighborhood unsupervised which I wasn't a fan of since I have cats I occasionally like to bring outside fully supervised into our fenced in back yard and I don't want it scaring away my cats. Tonight I come home to the dog running through my now broken fence to play with a dog several townhouses down (which is always on a lead) and I finally went and asked them to keep their dog on a lead so it would stop shitting in my yard and so I feel safe in my yard with my cats.

      "description": "Here's some background. My husband and I live in different cities because I'm a grad student in a university two hours away from his job. He recently interviewed for a job in my city, and he got the job. I notified everyone on Facebook because, in my opinion, it's the quickest way to send everybody one message.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom is one of those really emotional and narcissistic moms. I'm not gonna start typing the details of who she is because it's just gonna be an enormous wall of text. But to save you reading and me typing, she's not a pleasant person to be around or to interact with. Anyway, I am emotionally distant from her for all those reasons. I don't care to call her, text her, or anything like that. I love being away from her. She thinks that she's entitled to be some kind of special queen to me just because she's my mom, but things don't work that way. She's not a terrible person by any means. She's just a really unpleasant person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, fast forward. During the interviewing/waiting part, I asked a million people to pray for him. About two weeks after the interview, he got the offer. The day before, something funny happened, but I'll talk about it in r/funny or some other sub that's more appropriate. Anyway, he got the job. I notified everyone on Facebook and thanked everyone for praying for us. Then I get a text from my mom and, well, she's basically upset because I didn't notify her directly. Blah blah blah \"it's as if you don't have a family\" blah blah blah \"you show no interest in your family\" blah blah blah. Whatever, mom. If you wanted me to show interests maybe you should've treated me better when I was living with you instead of unconditionally favoring my siblings over me. (I didn't actually tell her that, but I was thinking it.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, AITA for not notifying her directly?

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/9t6ia5/comment/e8w8i1q?st=JNZIK2O2&amp;sh=2f75d5ee) is the link to my callout, so you can view the whole argument and my comment in context.\n\nSorry for being an asshole for being too lazy to tldr the argument here.\n\nMeh, I’ll just do it anyways and, like an asshole, not change that last statement because I’m too lazy. Redditor leaves a snarky comment calling another redditor racist for a comment that if it was racist was likely only unintentionally so. Second redditor turns it around on them by unnecessarily claiming that the accuser is racist for assuming the race of the people in the story and what they meant by their comment, even though they’re technically right and the first redditor is either being racist, a snowflake, or both. After wasting my own time scrolling through their argument, I then make myself the asshole by engaging in their petty bullshit, calling it out for what it is and them for what they are, blame them for “making” me make myself an asshole, and then further make myself an asshole by karma whoring it here, like a total asshole.\n\nLet the karma flow in, assholes.\n\nSorry, you guys aren’t actually assholes but I needed to add that last bit of assholery because I need to prove myself right in that I’m an asshole and it would be an epic way to end the post if it went viral. Like an asshole, I’ll just repeat myself since it would be that epic.\n\nSo, let the karma flow in, assholes",

      "description": "So, for context, I have 2 roommates. One we will call C, and one we will call F. While C and I get along just fine, I find that F and I butt heads a lot. Not that F is a bad guy, he is a clean and organized roommate, just not a great friend.\n\nNow, C has a girlfriend named M, who has never seen Lord of the Rings in her life. In fact, she just doesn't do movies well and finds action movies dull. So C and I were both surprised when we convinced her to try Lord of the Rings the following night. \n\nNow, M has a bad attention span with action movies, so I figured I would play it safe. I love watching movies with people who have never seen them. It let's me re-experience the movies through a different set of eyes. And I really cherish the LoTR films so I wanted her to have the best experience possible. I asked F is he was planning on having anybody over that night, and when he confirmed he wasn't, I asked if he could keep it that way. I told him what we were watching, and that I didn't want too many people there to distract her from the movie. He seemed to be a little put off, but he asked if he could watch it with us, to which I said \"of course dude, it's your apartment too\".\n\n\nWell, we get M over to watch the movie and get about 30 minutes in. M is watching intently, only talking to ask questions, and genuinely enjoying it.\n\nWhen we hear a knock on the door. It was F's younger brother, who we will call F2. Now, F2 was like 2 years younger than the rest of us, and is a really nice dude. F said he wanted him over to watch the movie too. So we say \"um, sure\", and F2 finds a seat.\n\nWithin 2 minutes, the brothers are now talking about their days and just random stuff in general. This goes on for a few minutes, and it wasn't exactly quiet. I noticed that M has started looking back at them, So I pause the movie, and just asked \"are you done? We're trying to watch a movie.\"\n\nThis got under F's skin, and he shot back that this was his apartment too, and he didn't like being told what to do. I responded that any other night, I wouldn't care, but tonight was a special night. And I asked him to respect that, to which he said he felt disrespected anyway. So he and F2 left. \n\nWe then watched the rest of the movie and M really enjoyed it. Asking when we could watch the 2nd one.\n\nI just tried talking with F about it, and he responded with hostility, stating that I put too much stake in movies and should care more about people. He also said that he invited his brother because I had asked him not to, and he said I had no right, to keep him from having people over.\n\nSo… thoughts",

      "description": "The yogurt place in question is Froyoland. I used to go there all the time with my dad, but he became a health nut and so we stopped going. I went there the other day with my GF after having not been for months, and they had a new fancy register. This one looked like an IPad and would swivel so that the customer could sign when they use credit and swipe and stuff. \n\nNow in case you don’t know, Froyoland is self serve. You pick up a cup, then you fill it from the frozen yogurt machines and add toppings. At the end you put your cup on a scale and you pay based on weight. \n\nSo I was a little confused when this fancy screen payment thing asked me what percent I wanted to tip. I chose 0%.\n\nSo here’s my deal. For one, I have no clue who I would be tipping, and for two, no one working there helped me do anything, so I do not see a reason to tip really. It’s not like a restaurant where the server, well, serves you. But on the other hand, I know some companies and restaurants are allowed to pay their workers less because they expect tips (which is messed up in itself, but that’s for another time and place). I don’t know if Froyoland is one of those places, and if by not tipping, I’m depriving the workers of their fair salaries. \n\nAITA",

      "description": "So, I (22 M) had a breakup recently (1.5 years), and one of the things she (20 F) cited as a reason she fell out of love with me was that approximately six months in, I had told her that I just couldn't keep listening to her talk about how her family doesn't approve of me and how they're influencing their thoughts.\n\nBackground: Her family is conservative/traditional to the point where they would only allowed her to marry within her culture. I am not of the same culture but we had met at work, developed feelings for each other and tried something out that got really serious. She told her parents about me and they immediately disapproved but we saw each other anyway. \n\nI tried my best to tell her that, despite how her parents may be making her feel, ultimately they love her and want the best life for her, even if it seems that they're being close-minded. \n\nThese conversations happened at least twice a month.\n\nShe traveled out of the country and told me how her parents were trying to find a husband for her. We had talked about that, as it was a real possibility at the time but she had assured me that she wouldn't get married off. I didn't want to make her choose between her parents and me so I tried to break things off. We ended up back together. \n\nAfter that she would tell me how her parents and siblings would lecture her about me. There were things about our relationship  that she had doubts on (mainly things far off into the future) and, using what she described as \"emotional manipulation\", her family preyed on.\n\nOur disagreements about our future used to be discussed honestly and openly. There were things that we could and couldn't compromise over but the best part was that we respected each other's firm points. What her family would do is talk about how we were raised differently and grew up in different lifestyles and couldn't possibly be compatible. She recounted to me tearful exchanges with her family and I tried my best to reaffirm her of my feelings and the lengths that I would go. \n\nThen, I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nEach of those conversations would wear me down little by little. I could handle her parents talking down, speaking poor of and generally hating me, but what was eating away at me was that she mind kept getting swayed and the possibility of a break up always lingered. The best way that I could describe it was that if it were me and her against her parents (so to speak) that I would be alright, but it felt like I was now going against all of them by myself. So, I told her this and that I can't keep reassuring her feelings everytime her parents tried to break them down. I needed reassurance too. \n\nSince then, our relationship had been a myriad of highs and lows and she had for the most part she had stopped with stuff like that. \n\nShe broke up with me a month ago and on the phone call, she told me that she felt like she couldn't talk to me about anything anymore. She was afraid I would be dismissive or distant if she had told me stuff like that. She said that she had been \"fangirlling\" over this new person she met. How nice he was. How he listened to her and how he truly understood what struggle she was going through.\n\nI'll admit that there were a few times that this topic came up again and I would frustratingly say things like \"not this shit again.\" I now know in hindsight, she wanted me to keep reassuring her of my feelings through words, rather than actions. \n\nI was at work today and something reminded me of her, so now I'm up at 3am trying to figure out if there's a learning opportunity, if this was a shitty situation or if I shouldn't be as regretful as I am.

She responds by saying a couple of rude comments about my outfit of choice and then offer to drive me to school so I could eat.\n\nAfter she left the table I told my brother we had to leave for the bus. He told me we had to stay and let my mom drive us to school. I tell him he can stay with my mom while I get on the bus since I didn't want to be in the car with her this morning after what she said. He called me rude and claimed that if I go he'll be forced to go too because I'm the little sibling and my mom says he has to watch over me. (Though that isn't true as my mom has let me go to the bus stop alone many times.)\n\nI say goodbye to my mom and tell her I'm going to the bus stop. She looks disappointed but alright with my choice. I leave for the bus  and when I look behind myself my brother is following me to the bus. When I ask him why he didn't go with mom all he says is: \"You made her sad.\" And we wait for the bus in silence.\n\nAm I the asshole? It's been eating me up since it happened (about an hour and a half ago)",

      "title": "AITA for cutting my sister out of my life?",
      "description": "A little background. My sister, 28, and I, 24, were very close growing up. Out of our family, she was the only one who shared interests with me, and was one of the only people I was ever close to as a result. Around 7 years ago, she began a habit of white lies that evolved into lying to everyone in her life. I used to spend a ton of time with her, almost every single weekend, hanging out and driving her to places as she had no vehicle. I can say that out of every person in her life that I saw here interact with or speak to me about, she lied to. I naively thought that since we were so close, I was the one person she never lied to, and when I eventually found out I was no exception, it started a several year-long back and forth deal where sometimes we would argue and sometimes we would be back to normal. Along with me, this \"we\" includes my dad as I currently live with him while attending college.  \n\n\nOne day, we discovered she was addicted to heroin and various other painkillers when she overdosed in her house with her daughter present(8), who ran down the street to a neighbor's for help. My sister was charged with child endangerment and spent 1 year in prison along with mandatory drug rehabilitation. After her release a few months ago, I thought she had finally changed for the better and we were back on friendly terms. She asked me to drive her to a friend's house to borrow some clothes where I waited in the car, and when we returned to my house, she collapsed, and later admitted that she had bought drugs from the friend and used them at home. Her daughter was also present at the time. I feel I should mention, my dad gained full custody of my niece and she's been affected heavily by all this. She has behavioural issues and regularly lies to everyone, and is seeing a counselor and therapist each week. About a month ago, during an argument over my dad refusing to give back custody immediately, my sister(who is recently pregnant) yelled that if she can't have her daughter back, she will just replace her with another kid. Again my niece was present at the time.  \n\n\nThis last act of betrayal has left me feeling... done. She contacted me via Facebook begging for my forgiveness, saying that she really will change now and that she misses her baby brother and wants us to go back to how we always were. I told her she was no longer the sister I grew up with and that I never want to see or speak to her again, and blocked her. She was over for Thanksgiving today, and I refused to look at or talk to her for the day.  \n\n\nMy entire family believes I'm being very unfair by not forgiving her, and they tell me everyone deserves a chance and that she has suffered enough without me giving her more stress by acting this way. My niece regularly approaches me and asks things like \"why won't you talk to mommy?\" I know addiction is an absolutely horrible thing, and it can grip you so firmly that even if you do want help, it can be hard to change. I'm beginning to feel guilty and as if I'm just being selfish by being unable to let go of the past and support her.  \n\n\nAm I being unfair? Should I suck it up and let her back in my life? ",

      "description": "We were sitting together on the train during peak hour so the train was getting pretty full. Some people were standing up. This lady gets on the train and is standing near me. She is a bit older, maybe in her 50s, and looks like she could use the seat more than me so I offer it to her.\n\nSo I've given her my seat now I have to stand up. There's not much space so I decide to move to  a different part of the carriage. I don't know why but I kinda expected my boyfriend would get up and come with me. I didnt see it as a big deal. But as I moved down I noticed he wasn't coming with me. Now let me say that I would not care at all if he came or not; he could keep his seat if he wanted and I wouldn't mind standing elsewhere. But I didn't realise he didn't want to get up. I made eye contact with him and gestured for him to come with me to stand somewhere else. He seemed hesitant but I didn't take much note of this and thought he just wasn't understanding my gestures (the train was very quiet so I didn't want to talk outloud).\n\nSo then he got up and we found another place to stand. Then he said, \"Why did you do that?\" \n\nI said \"What?\"\n\nHe complained about my giving up my seat and then making him move as well. He said I shouldn't have given the lady my seat and should have just remained seated. He was annoyed that I asked him to get up and thus made him lose his seat.\n\nWell again I just didn't see it this way. I give people my seat all the time as I'm young and fit, and feel guilty to make older people stand up. And I didn't see it as a big deal to stand up on the train, but apparently it was a big deal to him. Eventually he said \"It's ok don't worry, just don't do it again.\" Well I didn't realise he felt like this and again I wouldn't have cared if he stayed seated and I went elsewhere. But I didn't realise that is what he wanted at the time. AITA?",

      "description": "I (22F) have been dating my significant other (22MtF) for 7 years, on and off since high school. At New Years this year, she came out to me as trans. It wasn’t entirely unprecedented, as I had been the more dominant partner and she’d done some feminine things in the bedroom (cross dressing, enjoying being called she, and other more explicit things). \n\nI wasn’t sure what to think, and half-hoped it wasn’t serious. It seems she is, and has been taking more steps to embrace her female gender. She’s still closeted, since her parents are openly transphobic (her dad especially, step mom less verbosely). Additionally, her friends overall are also conservative (I think she may have confided in two or three now). \n\nFor brief background on myself, I’m pansexual and also raised conservative Christian. I am not out to my family, and always thought I’d keep it that way as, despite being pansexual, I have little interest in a long term relationship with women.\n\nNow with my boyfriend becoming my girlfriend, that would obviously have to change if we continue our relationship. We love each other very much, but the uncertainty and drastic change around this has me very confused. I’m even wondering how pansexual I truly am, which doesn’t help. I’m starting to wonder if I’d prefer our relationship to be platonic instead. \n\nWe’re long distance, but I’ll be seeing her in person next week for the first time since she’s come out to me (several states difference, her university just started its spring break). I think this will decide a lot on how I feel romantically and sexually towards her, as it’s hard to judge my feelings without being with her.\n\nBut, if I’m being totally honest, even if I’m still attracted and in love with her, I don’t know if I want the fallout of a lesbian/trans relationship from our families. It seems like a lot of drama and trouble, and I honestly don’t know how my family will react (negatively definitely, but I don’t know if it’ll range from quiet disapproval or all the way to disinheritance). It’s just never even been a hypothetical to them nor do they speak much on LGBT issues, so I don’t have much framework to predict them (contrast to my gf’s parents who will definitely be well past quiet disapproval). I love my family dearly and rely on them. \n\nMy greatest conundrum is my girlfriend not having a significant support system besides myself (and to be clear, I absolutely support her). If we break up, she won’t have that backup (I still want to be friends, but I think being in close contact after breaking off a seven year long relationship would be more painful than it’s worth without a break). She’s got an online forum of anonymous folks (not Reddit, she doesn’t like the layout) and has just started therapy. \n\nI also started therapy to work through my feelings and thoughts on the matter. I think part of this post is to vent but also, WIBTA if I broke up with her?",

      "description": "I have a coworker that I genuinely think is a good guy, but I don’t think he realizes how he’s coming off.  Once he gets started on a topic he’s interested in he will follow you around and go on and on about it.  He also says inappropriate stuff sometimes.  \n\n\nThe reason I want to address his behavior now though is because he’s making another coworker visibly uncomfortable.  The other coworker is very shy.  I’ve heard her speak only a handful of times besides when she’s dealing with customers.   Today he was talking about video game to her and doing his follow her around thing.  She wasn’t looking at him or responding.  I saw her walk all the way to the back of the store, then turn around and walk all the way to the front without doing anything.  It seemed obvious that she was just trying to get away from him, but he seemed oblivious.  \n\n\nWhen she walked back to the front I tried to pull his attention to me by making a comment about a video game I like, but he just said that he didn’t play it and right back to her.  \n\nI don’t think he means any harm, that he just doesn’t read social cues very well.  I know the other employee is an adult and it’s not really my place to speak for her and maybe I should just mind my own business.

      "description": "It is impossible to understand this story without context. TL;DR at the bottom\n\nWe were both in high school, we met each other through the Science Olympiad tryouts. She was passionate about microbiology and I was passionate about biochemistry, so we covered each other's blind spots during our competitions. Over our first year of events, we grew fond of each other, leading to a romantic relationship. We both wanted to study at the same college, and both wanted to work in a lab.\n\nAfter a decent amount of time together, I started developing symptoms of what later would be diagnosed as Hepatitis C. I told her immediately, and at the time I was not aware of any affordable treatment. She didn't mind and behaved normally, which I appreciated. However, after a couple of weeks, she began pointing out all visible symptoms during our conversations, most commonly jaundice and weight loss. It was irritating, because in the matter of half a month, she went from regular conversations to a continuous description of my condition.\n\nI told her to avoid talking about it. I was looking into human trials for Hep C treatments in other countries, but she wouldn't stop. So one evening I sent her a text saying \"I'm not quite comfortable talking to you. I'd like to take a break for a while until everything quiets down. I'm sorry.\" She replied with a \"That's ok, take your time.\" It seemed like she understood her mistake and wanted to give me time to recover.\n\nAfter 1-2 weeks of just greeting each other in the hallways, I was ready to get back into normal routine with her. I had found a relatively safe treatment that I would be taking over the summer, and was planning to tell her. Surely then she would stop mentioning my condition.\n\nBut now she began avoiding me in public, ignoring me if I tried to talk to her, blocked my email, phone number, social media etc., leaving one edited message: \"Hi thanks I'm done with you.\"\n\nFrom that day on, not a single word was exchanged. I tried asking for forgiveness, taking all the blame for ruining our relationship, asking her friends why she is acting that way... But nothing came of it. She just kept ghosting me.\n\nIt has been over 2 years, and I'm free of HCV and its symptoms now. I'm a freshman in college and she's still a senior in high school. I visited my high school a few days ago to chit-chat with my old professors, and she still avoided me in the hallways. To me, it seems like she hasn't matured one bit.  \n\nSo, AITA for handling the situation like I did? Is she TA and should I just move on without closure?\n\nTLDR; I get diagnosed with Hep C in high school. SO finds out, won't stop mentioning it in conversations. We both decide to take a break for my own sanity. When I find affordable treatment for Hep C, SO ghosts me. 2 years later, she still hides when she sees me in public. AITA?",

      "description": "I have a coworker who smells constantly. He’s a bigger guy, often late the work and greasy. Constantly sweaty, even though he’s sitting down at a desk the entire day. The smell is pretty bad, people have moved desks and don’t like sitting next to him. It’s common knowledge, and people always talk about it but never confront him or let him know. \n\nThe odor reminds me of back when I was in high school with two brothers. It is reminiscent of wearing the same socks for a couple days in a row and coming home from basketball or football practice. It’s old sweat, the kind that hasn’t been washed away and covered up with shit cologne or axe. It’s an odor that permeates your surrounds and there is no way to avoid it. \n\nI’m the type of person who doesn’t avoid conflict. While this isn’t a conversation I want to have with someone, one night we both were together late and I told him that he had an odor. He thanked me for letting him know, and for a couple weeks it went away. Soon enough, it came back and he was back to his old habits. Instead of letting it fill his general facility, he started dosing himself in axe during his breaks and coming back smelling like a middle school locker room. \n\nAgain I talked to him, and I suggested this detergent I use that is amazing for removing bad smells from clothes. For a while, he smelt like fresh linen before again going back to smelling like a used jock strap. So I took matters a bit further, I bought a diffuser with fresh linen scent and put it on his desk. This is where things escalated.\n\nOne of the guys I work with said “dude just so you know X is telling everyone you’re harassing him and he can’t do anything about the smell. I want to let you know I’m on you’re side but you need to get ahead of this”. So I went over and apologized, he was visibly upset but I tried to give my side saying I was trying to help and I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings. \n\nWell that backfired, apparently he had already submitted a compliant to HR. We had a lovely conversation about criticizing personal appearance. I was told he has no control over his body odor, I asked if there was a medical reason or any documentation stating he didn’t. Considering he would go through phases actually cleaning his clothes and showering it definitely wasn’t medical - but they did say I’m causing him to have panic attacks. \n\nAnyway, resolution was a simple verbal warning and to leave the situation alone. Okay sure, went back about my business no problem. Well, word spread and some people actually think what I was doing was intentional. Like I was trying to somehow harass him into taking showers and clean himself. While most people doing give a shit, there’s a collective group appealing to him playing the victim while trying to make the most drama out of this they can. \n\nIt has me second guessing my decisions, they aren’t worth the repercussions.

      "title": "AITA [23F] for not getting my cousin [23F] from the bus station in the middle of the night because I was tired?",
      "description": "So a bit of back story. I just recently moved to a new state for work after graduation. My cousin happens to go to school in a relatively close neighboring state, but she lives 6 hours away so it wasn’t the best situation for her. She had previously been driving down for her class (she only has it one day a week) and then either driving back up that night or sleeping at a hotel and driving up the next morning. So since I moved she’d sleep at my place for a night and then leave. I would usually get her from the bus station, and drop her off, and some days I would even let her drive my car to her school which was about an hour and a half away from me. Which still wasn’t optimal but better than before. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago I went to my home state on a business trip and was coming back up on the same day she came down. Great she could still stay at my place. So I let her know that I was driving up and she asked me when I’d be home I told her around 7pm-8pm which quickly turned to 8pm because it a couple of our stops and me having to take the rental car back all that. And she said she’d be there around the same time. I said where and she said my apartment. This is an important distinction because I live an hour away from the bus station meaning she would take the metro from the bus station to my apartment. And I said great and proceeded to complain about how tired I was if driving (my home state is 5 hours away). And it was only a two day trip (drove down, stayed the night, drive back up).  So I’d been doing a lot of driving. And I was actually exhausted, and in top of that I had to work the next day. \n\nWell 6pm rolls around and she tells me she’s stuck at a transfer stop and won’t be to the station until 8. My mental reaction was “Lol, okay well the metro is still running.” And all I said was “that sucks.” Didn’t hear from her until I get home and get settled and asked about where she is around 8:30. She calls me at almost 10 and she’s at a friends house eating dinner and then she invites me over and I’m like “No thanks, I’m tired.” Conversation got a little awkward and then I told her I was about to get ready for bed and let me know when she gets here. I honestly feel like this was a plot to get me to come up there so she wouldn’t have to take the metro (which I do admit would almost take 2 hours to get to my apartment) to me and would just ride with me when I came home. I get a text from her and she tells me she’s going to stay at her friends house for the night, but I should come over for dinner the next day. Once again I feel like this was just to get me to come get her and bring her home. Well I told her I had a lot to do and I didn’t hear from her after that until a few days ago. She wasn’t angry but she seemed a bit standoffish. We text quite frequently and that’s been the longest we haven’t talked to each other since I moved. \n\nThe semester is now over and I feel a bit relieved that she doesn’t have to come down weekly. But that also makes me feel a bit guilty because I shouldn’t be relieved to not see someone I care about. \n\nAITA for not picking her up that night and feeling relieved she’s not coming anymore?\n\nTL;DR I didn’t pick up my cousin, who was an hour away, after my 5 hour drive because I was tired. There was usable public transit but it would have taken longer for her to get to my apartment and it was late. AITA?",

After about 2+ years of being just friends, Will and I started hooking up. Then a few months in when I tried to figure out what kind of relationship he wanted, Will sort of freaked out, got really depressed, told me we weren’t compatible / had no future, so I ended things with him. \n\nIn the meantime I was still really close with John- John is a huge flirt and has always been really touchy with me, etc. but I always read it as nothing serious. But one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. I knew it was a bad idea because even if Will didn’t have feelings for me anymore, John and Will are super close and while we were together Will insisted a few times that John had feelings for me. John told me he didn’t care about hurting Will and that being with me was more\nimportant. I didn’t really make a decision about John, but told him that maybe in the summer when we were back in the same state (he graduated college and moved back home, a few hours from my hometown) we could see if there was a point to us being more than friends.\n\nI came back to school for spring semester and Will hit me up. He told me how much he missed me, how we belong together, etc. At first I got really mad at him because I really cared about him and the stuff he said before things ended sucked. But we talked through some stuff for a week and ended up back to basically dating without actually committing to it outloud. \n\nIts been a couple months and even though Will and I technically aren’t in a committed relationship, I pretty much live at his apartment and I know he’s not seeing anyone else. He knows there have been other guys while we weren’t talking but he doesn’t know about John.\n\nWill absolutely loves John- he kind of idolizes him. And even though John hasn’t been acting like it, I know he really cares about Will too. I don’t want to come between them. The only other person who knows is Will’s other best friend, this guy Tyler who is also one of my closest friends. I told Tyler right when it happened, back when Will and I weren’t even talking, and Tyler’s immediate reaction was that Will shouldn’t know because he would be really upset.\n\nI want to talk to Will about what our relationship even is, but this secret has been holding me back. I really really don’t want him to be hurt or feel insecure. And I don’t want to damage a relationship Will really values. Obviously if Will asked me if anything happened between me and John, I wouldn’t lie to him. BUT he never has. AITA for not telling him about something that happened when we weren’t even talking?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other since roughly the end of August 2017. Around that time she got a part time job at an event business with one of her good female friends. Now fast forward to today, we have been talking for a few weeks about me getting a job there also part time just to help with bills because we now live together. As we're driving and talking about the possibilities of people finding out that we are dating, she says that there's something she has to tell me, but that it shouldn't be a problem. After about 20 minutes of me having to coax it out of her, she tells me that when she first got the job there, she had sex with somebody who worked there. Now I immediately said that I no longer have any desire to work there. This person still works there and that means there's endless possibilities for things to go wrong in my mind, not to mention this place already has a toxic and gossipy group of employees.\n\nTo be clear, my issue is not so much that it happened, but more so that she just didn't tell me any of this until the very last minute, and she also can't seem to understand why I now refuse to even think about working there.\n\nMy other big problem is that I know our timeline as far as our dating history, and she seems to be changing it to fit her story. And I also need to mention that she confessed to sleeping with somebody else about a week or so after we started seeing each other, AND I FUCKING LET THAT SLIDE\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend are freshmen in college and although we've only been together four months we're moving quite fast and things have been very serious for at least three of those months. I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,\n\nI have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.\n\nRecently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.\n\nThe thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes. I tell her she can go but that it would make me a little uncomfortable. She doesn't go and makes me feel like an asshole for \"not letting her go\". Am I truly the asshole?",

      "description": "Some background is required, because I realise how the title sounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (19M) met this girl (19F) last January because we are in the same course and we became really close really quickly. We'd watch movies together, hang out for hours on end and we'd go clubbing with the same group of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround April I realised I had feelings for her, and told her one Monday - she said she didn't like me like that, that there was another guy in the year. 'Fair enough', I thought to myself and considered that the end of it. Well the following Thursday she stayed over at mine, and we stayed up until 5:30am chatting in bed (nothing sexual happened). She told me that she had feelings for me as well as this other guy. We left it at that, but the next day she said that she had thought about it and we should just stay as friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat ensued for the rest of term was me liking her and her spurning any sort of advances, but she still stayed over and drunk texted me and facetimed. When we broke for Summer, we kept in sporadic contact but nowhere near as often as we did during the academic year. I thought I was over her and returned to college afresh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoy was I wrong. Liked her just as much in September than I ever did, and her increasingly shitty behaviour didn't change that. She would insult me both in private and in front of my friends, she would demand I ring her and get pissy when I couldn't and told another girl in the class that I was obsessed with this other girl. She fell out pretty hard with her best friend, and I had to explain to her why screaming at someone isn't the best for morale. All my friends said she was toxic (even last semester) but I refused to listen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the asshole part:  So I texted her a week after to try to make amends after an argument we had, and within 2 minutes of meeting she was telling me how she was seeing someone and how great he was and how he knew about me and how she told him I'm \"The Jealous One\". My pride battered a fair amount, I told her I was happy for her. If she had said \"Thanks\" or even nothing after this we'd probably be back to being best mates again. However, she said, verbatim, \"Fuck off, I don't need you to be happy for me\". I thought it was such an unbelievably shitty thing to say, especially since she knew I still liked her, and I haven't talked to her since except being cordial/civil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here, or is this some prime /r/niceguys material? All my/our friends are basically telling me I did the right thing, but am I just being uber-selfish here? I hope we can eventually go back to being friends, but I'm not sure when I'll be ready for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Got friendzoned, proceeded to stop talking to her when her behaviour and boyfriend meant that I could no longer delude myself into thinking she'd like me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry for the haphazard writing, proper train-of-thought stuff.",

These plans were made quite a while ago and that date they are supposed to come is about two weeks from now. However, recently two of our friends said that'd they'd want to bring an extra person, a person we do not know. My BF was immediately uncomfortable with the idea as he's very distrustful of people and didn't like the idea of having a stranger in his house. My sister (who was supposed to come up too) even agreed with him, and although I personally don't see an issue, I eventually just went with it. We tell them that they cannot bring their friend, and one of the two states that he will not be coming if his friend cannot. The other one then follows stating that he as well will not be coming. I then suggest that rather coming to our sorry college town, that we should just go to Orlando and chill at Disney and get an Airbnb. They said that this idea was too expensive. We then say that they can come to our college town and just get an Airbnb, but were offended by us even mentioning it. In the end we decided to cancel the trip because things got too complicated. My BF was also not excited with the idea of having 8 people in our two bedroom one bathroom apartment, and having to entertain that many people, including a stranger, in our slow, dull, college town. However they stated that they had to take off work for these days and were really excited and are very close friends with us and we feel bad. That's why I'm here today asking, AITA?",

      "description": "**Reposted this on a separate account and have friends on the main one so writing on a secondary account**\n\nI've only got a new job after 10 months of being unemployed and living off my parents. I still feel like shit for it. I only turned 20. Today I think the real me, the bipolar and depression has just kicked back in. I don't know how it started but it could be a number of reasons. I can admit I was a abit of a lazy bone growing up but in this situation I don't think that's the case. Simply put, I just don't think I can handle another call centre job again. Also, yesterday and today I let people know my real self which would be considered brilliant, however like on reddit It felt like a downvote into oblivion for me. I won't go into full context about the conversations I had with my team mates but it seemed like everyone completely disagreed and called me out for my own personal opinions and principles. It shook me up big time. I don't know how I'm gonna tell my family how much of a quitter or loser I am for leaving another job. I don't know how long I'm going to feel like this, is there something wrong with me? I'm letting them know today. I just needed to get this weight off my shoulders. I just feel like whenever I share an opinion ANYWHERE in the world I feel so passionate about I just get shut down or embarrassed because I sound wrong or an idiot. And then dealing with these types of customers in this job is just going to make my moods even worse. I don't know if I can get any other type of job. I simply do not know what to do anymore.",

      "description": "Hey Reddit, so I've been dating my girlfriend since the end of October. She's fantastic, we get along rather well and see each other often, about 2-3 times a week. Though most of those times it's only for a few hours at most around dinner time, she gets up early to teach and I tend to work late. Most of our recent dates involve food, then either talking, cuddling, or both...I just like spending time with her!\n\nOver the last month though, I've been getting kinda annoyed by how often she's been checking social media when we're together. I feel like it hasn't always been this way, maybe just my perception but more often she's been pulling out her phone and browsing Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Early on she would pull out her phone just if she got a notification. Now in the last few weeks she's just pulled it out unprompted. \n\nNormally that wouldn't annoy me too much, I don't care if she browses while we're not having a steady conversation or anything. But there have been several times now where we've been in the middle of talking and she'll pull her phone out as she's answering a question or I'm answering one of hers, and then she'll be focused on whatever app she pulled up, and the conversation will die from there. Totally kills the mood. \n\nToday I kinda lost my cool. We were cuddling on the couch after finishing a movie and were having a great conversation with a lot of laughs, and then she pulls out her phone and just starts watching a 12 minute long YouTube training video that she needs to watch for training for her teaching job. Totally unprompted, without telling me that she was going to do that. And then she just sits there in silence and watches the video. I stopped cuddling her and got up to take care of some unwashed dishes to let off steam, because I didn't want to say anything in the moment that would upset her. I probably wasn't as \"cuddly\" or talkative as normal the rest of the evening. \n\nAm I just being a selfish brat here, Reddit? AITA?",

      "description": "For background, BF and I have been seeing each other for a year or so. We have an open relationship, so we both are free to sleep with or hook up with other people. But there are 2 boundaries: always use protection and don't begin a romantic relationship.\n\nBF met G online a few months ago. They were hooking up, which I had no issues with. He would sometimes also hang out with her and her friends, which was also fine. Once, I asked if he was using protection with her, and he told me he was. However, the same day sometime later, he admitted he had lied and was not using any protection. We struggled with this for a long time, but I eventually forgave him because he seemed genuinely contrite and because the two of us hadn't been super clear about what the 2 boundaries were. After a discussion, resetting our boundaries and clearly stating them, and getting tested for STIs, we moved on. BF also mentioned that he no longer had a sexual relationship with G and they were solely friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut lately, it seems he always is with G. He spends time with her friends and feels obligated to do favors for them. He gives G rides to various places. During a recent crisis, he dropped everything to help G. He is even attending a family function of G's. He will frequently talk about spending time with G and has even been late to our dates because of things he's doing with G (although he is late for other reasons as well). I understand wanting to maintain a friendship with G, but it feels so much like the two of them are dating and are in a romantic relationship. I've asked BF to stop doing such \"boyfriend-y\" things with G, but he has insisted that he is only being a friend and that I am projecting my own insecurities onto this relationship. AITA for wanting my BF to change his relationship with this girl?",

      "description": "This whole situation is short, but pretty messy.\nBasically, two years ago I realized I was FTM and I came out at school a few months after that, and then my school, regarding the laws in my home state, were forced to out me to my parents. My dad was the one I came out to first because I knew he'd be better at dealing with it than my mom.\nMy mom's from Russia, and so she obviously doesn't have the most accepting views in the world. When I came out as bisexual to her before I told her I was transgender, she just told me it was a phase and that I would end up straight regardless. She also had a penchant for believing that boys were smarter and more capable than girls, and that a woman should spend her time at home and caring for the household. She would occasionally curse and scream at me and my siblings, and sometimes hit us as well.\nAfter I came out as transgender, my mom tried to ignore the whole situation, opting to still use the wrong name/pronouns, and would just laugh at me if I tried to correct her, calling me silly and that I didn't know any better. That caused a lot of anxiety on my part, and made me constantly doubt myself and who I am.\nI get that she wants her child back, but I'm still here, and I was always here as her son, she just can't see past the fact that I'm not a girl. This culminated about a year ago when I made the decision to stop talking to her entirely, I just couldn't handle how she viewed me and treated me. I don't eat what she buys, I don't take her gifts, and I take the hour long walk home from school just so I don't have to interact with her.\nEven my grandmother, also from Russia, who had never even heard of a transgender person before still understands the fact that she should use my male name/pronouns.\nBut now, my mom's trying to talk to me again, my brother says she uses my name and tries with my pronouns, but I really don't think I can ever forgive her or forget just how much she had affected my mental health in such a negative way.\n\nAm I the asshole here because I can't move on?",

      "description": "This literally just happened but I’ve made sure to calm down first before doing anything. So, basically, my mum had a friend visiting from overseas last week and I hung out with her daughter too so we got along fine and I didn’t mind the visit since it was only for a few days. \n\nDuring one of the days, they’ve decided to go out to the casino and left me to look after the daughter and their younger son (who was around 3). I was fine with this but before they went out I let her friend borrow my nice boot heels that went over the knees because she didn’t have any shoes other than trainers. Please note that I ONLY LET HER BORROW IT. I didn’t say she could have it. She didn’t ask to have it. Nothing. Just borrowing. \n\nThen a week later (today), I’ve found out that she has given her friend my heels, the heels that I have paid for with my own money. My mum didn’t bother to ask me if her friend could have it, she just gave it away like it was hers. She didn’t even bother to mention it for a whole week. \n\nI really like those heels, I can’t get another because I’m a student with two part time jobs just to support myself through university. I’ve never asked my mum for any money and everything I have was paid with my own money. I had plan tonight and was planning on wearing those heels but now I can’t. She called her friend to keep it for me but I still don’t know if I’ll ever going to get it back. \n\nI got angry because when I confronted her, she didn’t care and basically just go “oops”. I told her about the plan tonight I had and she was literally just going “oh well. Tough luck.” (Translating her reaction to English equivalent as we’re not English)\n\nSo AITA for getting angry at my mum over the boots/heels? Am I overreacting?\n\nTLDR; My mum gave away my favourite heels to her friend from oversea without asking me nor mention it until a week later. When confronted, she doesn’t care and I got angry as I’ve paid for them with my own money. AITA?",

      "description": "Right off the bat I know the title sounds bad. I'm usually against this \"getting offended culture\", especially when it's very for very minor things but please hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of background, my entire family is Christian, I was baptized and raised as a Christian as well. I used to go to church and sometimes even sing there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, due to discovering I was bisexual, I started doubting this religion, I started looking on both sides of the argument as opposed to blindly believing into what my parents had been teaching me my whole life. Then I became an atheist as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to way later, I finally build up the courage to \"come out\" as an atheist to my mother. Needless to say she took it really bad, we had hour long discussions about the subject and I honestly feel like I should've just waited until I move out before telling her anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I was talking about about buying a new necklace for myself (specifically getting her input on what size would be best for me). When I was younger, I used to wear a necklace with the cross as pendant. She started making jokes about how I'm an atheist &amp; are trying to \"replace the man that died for my sins\" with cheap scrap metal and laughed at the jokes herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis wasn't the first she had made those kind of remarks and usually I let it slide thinking that telling her to stop would just be causing more trouble. But this time it really got to me so I went into her room and asked if I could be serious for two seconds with her. Then I ask her if she could stop laughing and making jokes at the expense of me being an atheist. From her point of view it was a harmless joke and while I can see that, I told her I understood, but also that I would like for her to stop from now on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe always says she respects my choice and lack of religion but I really don't feel that in the way she handles the subject whenever we talk about it. I tell her that as well. She loses quite a bit of her temper and starts talking about how no subject should be tabu between us and that she does in fact respect my choice (which it still doesn't quite come across as to me at least).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo.. AITA?, one part of me feels bad for trying to get her to stop making jokes and feels I shouldn't try to censor her and it also feels a bit like going against my feelings on the matter of getting \"offended\" as well as not wanting to repress free speech. On the other side it really hurts me when she makes these type of comments/jokes, if it were some random person at school I wouldn't care in the least, but when it's your own mother doing what feels like making fun of you for your beliefs, it really gets to me.",

      "description": "On mobile, excuse typos and format.\n\nSo, I got married 5 months ago. Everything went great, it was a beautiful day except... our wedding photos are awful, we had a small wedding and planned it in a month, I took a friend’s recommendation about this photographer and... The pictures were messy, no direction at all from her on poses, my hair and my dress were really messed up in all photos and she never once came to me to tell me or fix my dress, there are very few photos of just my husband and I we actually like. \n\nNow for the dress part, in my country we have something called “destroy the dress” (or something along those lines) which basically means wearing it somewhere that might ruin the dress but for a photoshoot.\n\nSo I would like to hire a better photographer and go to the beach with my husband and take pictures there (in the water, etc) which obviously would take a toll on the dress. I really would like to make up for the wedding pictures, I’ve seen it done millions of times and the pictures come out stunning and my husband really liked the idea. \n\nI told my idea to my mother in-law and she FLIPPED, she told me how irresponsible it would be of me to ruin a dress that costed my mom so much money (my mom bought my dress) that I was being a brat and my daughter would want my dress and to ruin it just for the hell of it is incredibly immature.\n\nI very politely told her I disagreed and my daughter probably wouldn’t want my wedding dress anyways, I would feel very pressured if I knew my mom was saving her wedding dress for me. Plus, if possible I would love to buy my daughter her wedding dress like my mom did for me (if I ever have a daughter), so I would like to use my dress for something creative and meaningful to us since I’ll never use it again.\n\nShe continued to get mad and I changed the subject. I haven’t talk about it with my mom recently but before we found my dress she told me I could do whatever I wanted with it. \n\nI just don’t see the point of keeping it in a box forever? Mother in-law even made a comment about how if I was her daughter she wouldn’t even let me touch the dress after saying what I said because I was being ungrateful.\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I ruined my wedding dress for photos?",

This took place last semester.\n\n The professor a science course I take is an older gentleman in his eighties.  He is very soft-spoken and most of the time the room needs to be quiet to hear him. \n\nOn this particular day he was going over information that was going to be on the next exam. Students were answering questions here and there. One young woman would start talking over him before he even finished speaking. It was starting to annoy me. I hoped that she would stop, but everytime he spoke she would start up right behind him.\n\nI couldn't really register what he was saying and she showed no signs of stopping.  So I decided to say something. \n\n\"Excuse me, I can't really hear what Professor is saying. Could you be quiet so we can hear?\"\n\nInstead of just agreeing, she got angry and said something like \"Well maybe you need to switch seats so you can hear better.\"\n\nI responded \"I would be able to hear if you would be quiet!\"\n The situation escalated. The professor told me to be quiet. \n\nAITA here?  \n\n\n",

So then the following week Dan is like I am going and the friend who likes him(Ben) Says thats great he then gets a seat on the bus to go to the event and expects to go back to one of our houses which is packed already with the rest of us. Last time he went out drinking with us he acted the magget and ruined the night.

      "description": "Two months ago, I bought a collector's item off of a guy abroad for a little over $130. He offered me to send it untracked for a much cheaper shipping price. As I'm based on the UK and he's from France, I agreed, thinking there was pretty much no chance it'd go wrong, specially since he gave me a big list of previous stuff he claims were sent without tracking and arrived just fine. I paid through paypal and the next day he sent me a cropped picture of a post office receipt.\n\nTime passed, the ETA came and went, but nothing arrived. I kept communicating with him, and he asked me to wait. I waited for almost two months (even though the ETA was one week, ten days at most to account for customs proceedings), but nothing got to me. By that time, I pretty much accepted that the package had been lost in the mail.\n\nI contacted the seller to talk about asking for paypal's customer protection for a refund, but I didn't want him to lose out on what I then thought was a postal fuckup. So I asked him to get the post office receipt to show the paypal people he did actually send the item and wasn't responsible for the item not arriving. Then he claimed he didn't have the receipt anymore, and couldn't get another at the post office. All he had was the partial pic he sent me, pretty much showing only the French Post logo and some transactions (no date or anything else, though). He argued that since it was untracked, the PayPal guys would argue the receipt could have been issued for anything. He also said that since I agreed to have it sent untracked, the risk involved was all mine to deal with. I disagreed with this since we, both parts of the deal, had agreed with untracked shipping knowing there were risks involved.\n\nThen I decided to check the date the receipt was issued through a serial number, and it showed it had been issued on a different date than the one he claimed it had been. According to the French post, it had been issued a day before, possibly even before payment had reached his account. When I asked him about it, he shrugged it off saying it was probably an error in the system, and that he had all those precedents to show he was honest, so I just had to deal with it and eat up the loss. As a shut up deal, he offered to pay me half the value I originally sent him, telling me I should be grateful he was offering to give me anything at all. All the while, he was very rude about it.\n\nI wasn't convinced with his explanation, was kinda bugged about his attitude and by then the whole situation reeked of scam, so I just went ahead and contacted PayPal about the refund. Ends up I got it in full. Have no idea if the seller had to pay up or not, as I blocked him. AITA?",

I wasn't with them when this happened so I only have my friends story.\n\nMy friend and my brother went fishing in in nearby river and two foreign men also went fishing nearby. Eventually the foreign men caught a big fish. After this he decided to kill the fish ( maybe for eating but not sure). I don't think this is illegal in my country (Netherlands), but it was a really beatifull fish and it was pretty rare. So my friends' brother got really upset about this and went up too them and out of anger he pushed the guy that killed the fish into the water. \n\nThe foreigners arround our village are known to not having a lot of money and the person probaly had his phone on them. The water was also pretty cold. So my friends' brother ruined this guys day. The only reason I can think of that he is not the asshole is because there is really no need to kill these fish for food. Even if you don't have a job or a job that pays really bad you should be able to afford food in my country. So he didn't have to kill that fish. A fish of the size and kind  he caught is really rare arround here so I kinda understand why he'd push the guy into the water.\n\nDo you think he is the asshole?

On the one hand, I feel like I am allowed to hang out with my best friend doing our thing without needing to make it a girls group outing. Also, if Beth wanted to hang out more, I would be happy to join in if she organized anything.

Jane was the new girl in school and became a part of our friend group, which also involved John. John and Jane had a crush on each other and they both told me about it so I was like \"hey, you guys should go out\". And they did, and they had a good relationship for a while. Eventually, John just hardly ever talked to Jane outside of school and almost never interacted with Jane while in school so when Jane told me about this I was like \"hey, you should break up with him\". And they broke up. I feel incredibly guilty considering they're both depressed and John just told me that this break up made his depression worse. Part of me thinks I'm not the asshole because I got them together because I thought they were a match and in my opinion I had genuinely good intentions, but the other side of me thinks I'm guilty because what I did was VERY two-faced.

She gets jealous if I talk to any of my exes, but my exes are exes for a reason and I never initiate conversations with them to begin with. I also keep conversations with exes short and curt, as I generally don't want to interact with them myself (I would never knowingly accept nudes from exes either, but none of them know this account exists so that is a moot point).\n\nI just want to know if I should refrain from getting nudes from other people for a higher moral purpose, I guess.",

      "title": "AITA for not always letting my [24F] boyfriend [29M] touch me when/how he wants? AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for touching me after I’ve said stop or no?",
      "description": "TL;DR If I [24F] don’t want touched a certain way or at all some times, I explicitly tell my boyfriend [29M] of 9 months to stop touching me; this makes him feel unwanted and unattractive. I get angry with him for not adhering to my nonconsent. AITA?\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nFor context: \n\nSometimes touch is very overwhelming for me and I don’t want touched at all. It gets me stressed and cranky. Sometimes I do want touched. I’m always very explicit with this. “I don’t want touched right now I don’t feel well” or “I’d love to cuddle if you’re down.” I told him this when we very first started dating. That sometimes physical touch is too much for me and I need space in those moments.\n\nHe definitely feels he deserves to be touched more and to touch me more. I know that my sensory-overload makes him angry. Telling him explicitly to stop touching me or telling him no hurts his feelings but are the only way I can get him to understand. Dropping hints are either not being noticed or they’re being ignored, I can’t tell which. And by hints I mean anywhere from “I don’t feel good” to “I’m going to lay on the other couch during the movie.” He’ll always come touch me or he’ll have his feelings hurt if I move.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is a summary of what happened tonight: \n\nwe are sitting next to each other on the couch eating dinner. I ate waaay too much and my stomach hurts really bad. I really don’t want touched at all honestly, but I really really don’t want to fight so I’m ignoring the discomfort and he just has his hands on my legs. He reaches to rub my stomach. I say “i don’t feel well and I do not want my stomach touched. I don’t want to have sex tonight.” (He always rubs my stomach when he’s feeling horny, and I hate having my stomach touched). He huffs and says “but I think you’re sexy.” He puts his hand under me and grabs my butt. I’m fine. 20 seconds or so pass. His hand goes into my crack. I say stop and I move. He gets mad and says he is “allowed to touch me.” (He says that often.) I ignore his comment. A few minutes later, he grabs my boobs. I tell him “stop, I don’t feel well.” He says something to the effect of “you never let me touch you.” \n\nAnd we delve into a huge argument where I’m apologizing for making him feel poorly but telling him that I cannot imagine a healthy relationship where either party has to sacrifice their right to say no. And he’s telling me I make him feel unattractive and gross and unwanted. I explain that having my nonconsent ignored IS gross and isn’t sexy at all. He says I called him gross. I didn’t I said not being able to say no is gross. He says he is allowed to touch me. I say that no he isn’t, not without my consent, and that right isn’t sacrificed whether we’ve been together 9 months or if we’ve been together 40 years. It continues much like that.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nI am really angry and feel like I have absolute right to say no to anyone’s touch, up to and INCLUDING my boyfriend, but I maybe am neglecting him physically by doing so, and that makes me the ass hole?

I agree to play with him and I tell him I’m decent but I’m not the greatest. We start playing and he tells me we don’t have a healer so he tells me to be the healer. Support is what I’m best at and what he’s worst at but I don’t like playing support so I pick some ninja guy who I thought looked cool. He gets really annoyed and says that our team is going to lose as nobody else is picking support. He caves in and plays as a support class and does really bad with it. He tells me to switch to support because I’m doing bad with my character, he’s doing bad as our support and our team is losing. I don’t have fun playing as support so I just keep trying out different characters.  My girlfriend is also with me so I let her play while I go bathroom. She’s even worse than I am and by the time I get back my team has already lost the game. He’s pretty mad and I think he’s rank went down or something. In my opinion the point of games is to have fun and I don’t have fun when people are telling me how I should playing. It’s just a game and I think he took the whole thing too seriously ",

Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?",

I let him know that pretty much everything on our menu has garlic in it, and if it's in a sauce, we won't be able to make it without it. He said he understood. He then proceeded to order some kind of pasta dish with red sauce that has garlic in it, a salad with italian dressing that has garlic. he went through 2 baskets of garlic breadsticks, and he asked for them to have garlic. I made sure to let him know how much garlic was in everything he was ordering, and while he was eating, I checked in on him a couple of times to make sure everything was fine, and he gave me a nod or a thumbs-up.  \n\n\nWhen it came time for him to finish up, he looked visibly agitated, and he said he needed his check because he had to leave.

      "description": "I’m not afraid to speak my mind, especially when I’ve had a few drinks. I’ve had this conversation with her before privately when we first met, but it came up last night and she ended up leaving because she felt upset. \n\nEssentially my friend has been dating her boyfriend for 6 years now, and their relationship isn’t strange at all. They are almost exactly two years apart, now 20 and 22. They are family friends and began dating secretly at the time. My point is, it’s weird that a 16 year old was ever interested in a 14 year old, no matter how “mature” she was. \n\nI’m not going to go into deep detail, but in my opinion when they started dating it was predatory because he had “easy access” to someone who is, in my opinion, significantly more mature. In the teen years, every single year you mature a huge amount. I understand that some boys mature slower than girls, but I wasn’t friends with anyone who was interested in 13 year olds when we were 15, 14 and 16, or 15 and 17. The people I knew back home who were dating girls younger them were commonly referred to as pedos and predators because they are taking advantage of girls who know no better. \n\nObviously, their relationship has worked out, and no a 20 year old dating a 22 year old is not strange to me at all. Last night though, we were all sat around having a few drinks (10ish of us) we started bickering (which, I honestly don’t remember how, I was very inebriated). It got personal very quickly, and she made an underhand jab at me, at which I replied “at least my boyfriend isn’t a pedophile.” \n\nShe was very upset by this, and started getting in my face and putting words in my mouth to which I replied, quite meanly, “there is a difference between giving consent and being taken advantage of.” After which she left for a cigarette and went back to her flat. \n\nI can agree that the way I brought it up was insensitive, and I am going to apologise for the way I put my points across and the fact that there were other people around probably made her feel humiliated. However, I don’t think my actual points are wrong. Some of our friends are saying they disagree with me, and that maturity levels are different between different people, while others totally agree with me, saying that there is too much of a gap at that age — and the fact that he had easy access to a younger girl is taking advantage of her. \n\nSo, Tl;DR: I told my friend that her dating a 16 year old when she was 14 was predatory.

      "title": "AITA for explicitly stating I am not going to contact my autistic brother?",
      "description": "My brother and I used to live together until eight months ago or so. We had lived together and talked daily in passing for at least six years. He moved out because he needed to (30, living in the basement, smelled, and never had a job or tried to find one) and I was getting married. We talked and I offered to be the one to leave, but he chose to go instead so I didn’t kick him out.\n\n\nAfter that, he didn’t call. He didn’t write. He didn’t initiate contact once. He would take many days to reply to a text and be upset if I suggested social norms suggested texting back sooner than 6 days. I have only seen him for major holidays because of my parents and because months later he still hadn’t changed his address so he would pick up mail. Even when he was at a holiday he would be alone on his computer.\n\n\nAfter months of almost no contact after living with him and talking to him daily, I indicated I was very hurt that he did not seem to want me in his life and that he never expressed any indication that he loved me or even cared about me. I even asked him when the last time he said I love you to anyone was. His reply was less than a week ago. He has not once ever said this to me. Not once. \n\n\nAt that point, all I felt was mourning the loss of a brother. It’s like he vanished from my life and like the only reason he talked to me before was because we lived together, not because he wanted to. It felt like the whole time I was living a lie. So I told him I wanted a relationship with him, but he had to be the one to initiate contact. It hurts me every time I contact him and he doesn’t... do... anything and he just sounds like he wants to stop talking and be left alone. He told me I was being overly sensitive and emotional and that he did want a relationship.\n\n\nThe kicker is he is autistic. I don’t think he feels the same needs in a relationship as I do. I don’t think he wants a monthly phone call and doesn’t understand why I do. He doesn’t understand why I’m sad, though I have explained myself. I think he is being hurtful and showing that he does not care about a relationship with me. I specifically stated what I needed from a relationship with him if he wanted to have one (which wasn’t much, just a 5 minute phone call once a month and maybe actually doing something on holidays with his family instead of his computer). He couldn’t be bothered to humor me for five minutes once a month. I’ve done so many things to humor him and his quirks. Even if I don’t understand why he wants things, I’ll go along with it. And he won’t do the same. \n\n\nSo I said I’m not going to contact him again because it hurts too much. Now my parents are calling me wrong for not engaging with him and that I should tolerates these hurtful behaviors from him “because he is different.”  \n\nSo am I the asshole for not contacting a brother who doesn’t seem to care anyways?

At this point im on the brink, I usually have a good temper but when it comes to my cat... oh boy.

      "title": "AITA - I defended my girlfriend from a naked girl in a concert pit",
      "description": "Hey everyone.\n\nIt’s been almost two years but I am still upset at a situation I found myself in at a music festival. \n\nMe and my girlfriend were 10-15 rows back standing against the side railing of the pit in front of the stage at a concert during a festival in 2017. It was a pretty high energy show but we put ourselves to the side so we could just watch and have a good view of the stage.\n\nAbout 5 songs in this naked girl starts running through the crowd. People are visibly upset and asking for security. However, all the security guards are men, and won’t lay their hands on her and are letting her run a rampage in the crowd waiting for the one female guard to come from a stage somewhere else at the festival. Security eventually does talk her into coming to the side of the pit on the gate, right behind us, where they try to talk sense to her, but she keeps screaming and running back into the crowd and returning a couple minutes later. We are about at the 7th song in the set now. She keeps bumping into my girlfriend really rough when she runs in and out of he crowd and my girlfriend can’t reason with her to stop.\n\nThe next time she runs over to us the security have her top that she dropped by them before and ask her to put it on. She’s clearly capable, but for whatever reason asks my girlfriend who’s facing away from her for help putting it on. My gf is pissed, and ignores her, and the girl immediately reacts to being ignored by jumping on her back and pushing her to the ground.\n\nI didn’t have time to think about my reaction. I stepped into her and grabbed her wrists, I pinned them to her shoulders, and pinned her to the barricade. I make some kind of speech I can’t remember about her needing to chill out because she isn’t being cool. She freezes. I look around for anybody to come and help me. A friend of hers. Security standing just feet away still watching. The longest 10-15 seconds of my life pass and a security guy plays down what she did as something stupid and they are trying to get help with, let her go. \n\nI took a step back, gave her space, let go of her hands, and security had about 5 seconds to try and talk to her before she began screaming and throwing her arms in the air and running into the crowd barreling through people like the last minute didn’t just happen.\n\nPeople came up to me on the barrier a handful of times. Telling me that they saw what happened but I need to keep my cool because it would be dumb for me to get kicked out. It sounds like they say it in a way that they sound to me like they are saying I was wrong. I had a couple people come all the way through the crowd, get my attention, and flip me off and fuck myself for putting my hands on her.\n\nThe girl eventually makes her way to the front of the crowd where security pulls her over the rail and out of the concert. The performer sees the naked girl and is impressed by the streaker at her show, and dedicates the next song to her. I feel like a victim in the situation where the person who just knocked over my girlfriend is praised for being a class A jackass... from my perspective obviously.\n\nI’m still not over how angry that day made me.",

      "description": "Backstory. My wife and I lived in an apartment complex. One night at 1am someone rang our doorbell 7 times. I answer the door and see my next door neighbor standing in front of his door. \n\nI ask him “did you ring my doorbell?” He mutters “What? No someone just rang my doorbell as well and doorbell ditched me.” I say “okay that’s weird, well goodnight” and go back inside. 10 minutes pass and he knocks on my door. I open the door and he says “Did someone doorbell ditch you again? Someone just did it to me again.” He introduces himself and gives me a dead fish handshake as he slurs his words. He’s obviously on some drugs.I’m eager to just tell him goodnight and leave me alone at this point so I say “No, I am going to bed, goodnight.” \n\nAt this point I’m a little weirded out. 5 minutes pass and I’m looking outside my peephole again. He’s standing in the hall in front of our door. Just standing there. I told my wife and she’s freaked out as well.  I leave to go talk to her. I go back to the peephole to see what he’s up to. At this moment he walking away from my door towards the elevator. All of a sudden he charges down the hall full speed and falls face first in front of my door. He must have broken his nose because he fell HARD.  My wife and I are shocked and call the cops. \n\nI hear the police come into the hall and into their apartment. I’m not sure what happened to them that night. The next morning when I’m leaving for work, every single persons doormats in my hallway are all switched around and there’s someone’s doormat in front of the door to the stairs. Fast forward a few weeks and he’s been loud until 4am every night. I knock on the wall to get them to quiet down. I did that one night and it didn’t seem he liked that very much. \n\nThe next afternoon our doormat is gone. My wife had just gotten this new doormat two days prior.  It was an official Disney doormat that was like $40. She’s obsessed with Disney and loved the doormat. My wife was crushed and full of rage. She stormed over and knocked on their door. He opens the door, looking like we just woke him up. She asks him if he’s seen our new doormat very snarky. He plays dumb and says he doesn’t know. He says “that really sucks, I didn’t see anything sorry.” and shuts the door. We look all over our floor until we find it. It’s all the way in a separate section of our floor down a hall of storage units, obviously looking like it has been thrown.\n\nI was really upset and annoyed but I was glad we found the doormat. Now we’re moving out of the apartment complex.  I grabbed his doormat and threw it in the dumpster outside. In hindsight, I feel like I shouldn’t have done it. Am I an asshole for throwing it away? \n\nTL;DR: My druggie neighbor got mad I knocked on their wall to get them to be quiet at 4am, stole and threw my wife’s new expensive Disney doormat down the hall. So I threw their doormat in the dumpster. \n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend is a relatively avid gamer (he games for 3-6 hours a night) and he usually is on mic, meaning others can hear us. Other important information is that we live in a (quite small) studio, so there is nowhere for me to go in order to minimize noise. It is also relevant that I am a singer, musician, and visual artist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets mad when I am too loud while he games. Obviously this means I cannot sing, play instruments, or really walk around (I tend to be very clumsy) and sometimes he even gets frustrated when I eat crunchy/loud foods like chips, carrots, etc. My main frustration is that he basically wants me to sit still for hours on end. I've asked him to give me breaks in the middle so I can walk around our apartment, eat, sing, or whatever. He also doesn't like the lights on, so I can't draw. In this time, I can basically (with headphones) can watch TV/ go on reddit/ text friends/ do whatever, that is quiet and electronic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently we had an argument because while I was trying my best to not disturb him, I was watching videos and I kept laughing, because they were funny. He asked me if I could stop laughing, and I told him I could sit in my car, the bathroom, or he could turn his mic off. He told me that it was very disrespectful to the people he was playing with, for me to keep making noise (and embarrassing to him.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is admittedly a dick move, but about 2 hours after he said he would be done, he kept shooshing me and I started singing at pretty much full volume, because I was tired of sitting on my ass in the bathroom, not even feeling like I was allowed to laugh in my own home (and it was really starting to hurt to sit on tile for \\~ 2-3 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk if this changes anything, but I think the thing that really frustrates me the most about this arrangement, is that he obviously values the enjoyment/comfort of the people he games with more than my own comfort in my own home (from my perspective). I feel like for indeterminate amounts of time I am on \"lockdown\" in a way- not being able to do any of the things that make *me* happy- or even sometimes comfortable, like eating. He makes me feel like I'm being a dick for disrupting other people's gaming experience, which I know I probably am, but AITA for thinking that maybe that shouldn't be the priority here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso thanks for reading this post. I'm sorry if it seems like the answer is obvious either way. I just feel like I really don't know, because he's treated me like the answer is so obvious, even though I feel completely differently. I also don't really feel comfortable asking anyone irl, because I think they would jump to conclusions really quickly, and either conclusion would be a judgement that concludes my being stupid/incapable.",

He ends up being alcoholic and abusive towards my sister and the next two years is a lot of back and forth, I started out feeling extremely bad for her cause I do understand how hard it is to leave an abusive relationship, however things changed when she kept going back to him even after getting police and my family involved multiple times, my parents have throughout the last two years had to “safe” her in the middle of night, pay to replace her broken stuff, given her money etc.\nWhile she has continued to go back to him even when he left her alone and when he wanted to change and went into rehab for her she decided to tell him no and continue to give him beers. \n\nMy niece ended up telling a teacher  “moms new boyfriend had told her he would kill her dogs and that she had seen him hit mom” the school obviously got involved and my sister said that she would leave him for real this time which she did and he moved far away.\n\nShe has after their break up ruined a number of family events birthdays, get togethers, Christmas etc. \nShe started to disrespect my parents a lot since they reacted when she started to contact him again and decided she wanted to move away (with my niece) to where he now lives to be with him. \n\nShe ended up moving away but my niece now has her address with her dad she only sees her every other weekend\n\nLast Christmas was it for me she was home for a week to see my niece and spend her Christmas with her. She didn’t spend even one full day with my niece, she was out with friends sniffing cocaine and having sex with ransoms. \nShe then decided to have a complete meltdown after our Christmas dinner and disrespected my parents yet again, even worse this time. She pushed my mom and grabbed my niece and said to her she was coming with her, my niece didn’t wanna go ane ran up to the room where my bf and I were staying in (we were upstairs) My dad ended up being able to get out of the house and in a taxi home. We then came down and saw that she had grabbed all my nieces Christmas presents. My niece was crying, shaking, confused and so afraid of her mother coming back to take her away. \n\nThat was it for me\n\nTDRL; cutting ties with my sister who continues to disrespect my parents and puts partying before her own child.

      "description": "Several years ago, my wife and I stopped talking to her dad and her step family completely. The can be nice people, but are incredibly toxic. Her step brother is a recurring drug addict, her step sister is in her 30s but has never held a job for more than 6 months, the step mom spends money they dont have like you wouldn't believe. \nNow her father has his own issues, and is obviously the biggest connection point to my wife. But for his entire life he was always irresponsible (except for his job). He simply could never understand finances, and basically just accepted being in massive debt. He had worked on HIS fathers land as a farmer for most of his life, and pushed all the other siblings out of his life in one way or another over the years. Before his dad died, my father in law gave him this long winded speech (we were present since the grandad was on his deathbed) about signing the farm and land over before he died to ensure the other siblings wouldn't sell it off. Sure enough, right after the grandfather died my father in law sold all the land in several sales in the course of three years to pay for all the stupid expensive stuff he bought. Wife and I actually offered to buy some of it, and he said \"I'm not ready to part with it yet\", acting as if he hadn't already sold some. He then said \"okay, I'll give you these 15 acres for $200k\". Way too much for us to afford, then he went and sold it for $100k a month later to a stranger.\nFast forward several similar asshole-ish events and 5 more years, and we simply dont talk to him anymore. Pretty much acting as if he doesnt exist.\nSince the holidays are happening, he contacts my wife and essentially asks \"what happened?\".\nWe havent ever given him a specific reason why we dont talk to him. Quite frankly, there was never one reason why, and I feel like if we were to have an honest conversation with him it would consist of hours and hours of pointing out all the obviously shitty things hes done in his life (to and around us).\nTL;DR - Oblivious Ass father-in-law doesn't realise he's an ass. Should we tell him why or just continue the silent treatment?",

      "description": "Hey guys, my guilty conscience and I are back! \n\nI have been spending the day with a friend of mine. She doesn’t drive and doesn’t like to be alone when her husband is at work, so wanted me to spend the whole day with her. I told her I would spend the day with her but that I had to spend most of the day studying for a huge test I have coming up. It’s in about three and a half weeks but it’s a MAJOR test. I am in graduate school and this is a comprehensive test of everything we learned throughout the past three years, and we need to pass it in order to graduate. In addition, it is on eight topics, so there is a LOT to memorize.\n\nAnyway, I had about a half hour to study before going to therapy, then after therapy I wanted to get right back to studying. My friend found out she has an interview tomorrow and wanted to get a new outfit for it. She “asked” (but more like demanded) me to take her to the store to get an interview-appropriate outfit. I get that it’s an interview and it’s important, but I really needed to study and I also spent last night and this morning taking her on her errands since she doesn’t drive. I just couldn’t take it anymore so I declined and said I couldn’t drive her. I know she needed to get something for an interview so I feel bad about it, but I’ve also been chauffeuring her around all day and really needed to study. Also note this is really the only day of the week I can study because I have class and work other days. Thursday is my study day.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR my brother believes there should be a religiously enforced quiet time between the hours of 8pm and 6am, including no talking anywhere in the house. I don't agree.\n\nSo my brother and I (23 and 25 respectively) live with our parents - I'm disabled and can't afford rent if I moved out, but help out around the house to compensate, and we have a roommate - a friend of mine - who pays rent and helps out around the house (pet sits, takes care of dishes, cleans up kitchen). \n\nMy brother, who doesn't pay rent, and who begrudgingly takes out the trash once a week if you remind him to, works fulltime as a banker, and he goes into work around 7am, waking up around 6am. Ever since he got this job, he's decided he needs to be in bed by 8pm every night, sunday through friday, with the sole exception being saturday, when he'll stay up until 2am playing games with friends online. \n\nI wouldn't have any issues with this, except he expects everyone in the household to be quiet after 8pm so he can fall asleep without being disturbed. I'll be out in the living room watching tv, maybe talking to my roommate, and get a text from him asking me to keep it down because he's trying to sleep. So I'll turn the volume down on the tv (until I can barely understand what people are saying) and if I'm chatting with my roommate, we'll turn to not-quite-whispering levels of quiet conversation. This isn't enough for my brother. If he is trying to sleep, any media not restricted to headphones, or any conversation, is apparently far too much, and if you talk after his designated bedtime, he sends constant text messages nagging you to be quiet.\n\nTonight, I'm celebrating Valentine's Day with my roommate - basically just hanging out, drinking a bit of wine, eating cheese and berries and chocolate, having a nice relaxed time in lieu of any partners or romantic plans. At 9, I got the standard message; \"can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep!\" So I reply affirmatively, and my roommate and I turn down the volume, but continue to talk and hang out, not ready to wind down for the night. Next thing I know, my mom calls me to let me know she just got off the phone with my brother, who was complaining that we were making too much noise. I had to go to her room and explain we were being quiet, but didn't intend to go to bed just yet as it was not yet 10pm on Valentine's Day and we had a right to enjoy the holiday outside of his self-designated socializing hours. My Mom agreed but advised we just \"try to be quieter\" in the spirit of keeping the peace.\n\nI guess most of my anger is that if he were paying rent, or helping out around the house at all, contributing in any way, and I had agreed to be quiet past 8pm, I would find it reasonable, if extreme, that I'm not allowed to talk to anyone past 8, but as it is, he works because mom gave him an ultimatum a few years ago that he needed to find a job (with the understanding he'd help with rent or bills) or help out more around the house, and he chose to work, but he goes to work, earns a paycheck, contributes none to the household, and uses the job as both an excuse to not do housework and a reasoning for why he's better than me (again, I'm disabled, wheelchair bound when not bedridden, and still do what I can to care for the pets and clean the house to earn my keep). Sorry, this is turning into more of a rant than I intended.\n\nSo basically, I don't see a reason I should put my life on hold at 8pm almost every night, when he contributes nothing to the house, and especially when he's not tried exploring other ways to fall asleep that doesn't rely on my silence, like a white noise machine, or listening to music to fall asleep. Am I the asshole for not accommodating his need for silence?",

      "description": "It's been 6 months since this incident. And it still effects me a lot. I wrote this on my phone and didnt proof read it. Hopefully it's legible. Props to anyone with the patience or anyone who took the time to read and try to u derstand my ramblings.\n\nOkay, so making a title for this was hard. But I need to give a lot of background information so everything is clear. \n\nAug of 2017 my dad died in a car accident. Sept of 2017 I got married to my wife, we had been together for over 10 years. No kids. Oct of 2017 my wife shares with me that she is pregnant. Feb 2018 I find out I have thyroid cancerand I quit my job. Mar 2018 I get surgery to have my thyroid removed. Apr 2018 I take radiation to make sure cancer is gone. May my daughter is born a month early. I am still off thyroid medicine at this point so my body is no where near operating normally. Extream bouts of depression and anxiety are common. My daughter is in nicu for 3 weeks before coming home. She had a bleed above her skull which they assumed was the reason my daughter had been stopping breathing over the last few weeks. Every day we visited our daughter and watched her stop breathing and need to be stimulated to breathe multiple times a day. Daughter finally comes home, and 1 month later my wife has to return to work dispite my protest of being uncomftorable being left alone with our daughter. Even though she hadn't had any issues since coming home. I've always been uncomfortable around babies that cant support themselves. To which i expressed to everyone many months in advance. I would need a lot of support and understanding until my daughter could support her own head. Everyone apparently thought i would just be fine when the time came. I wasn't. But I wanted to be. So while my wife went back to work my mother in law would help watch our daughter. Not going to lie she took care of our daughter alone basically 8 hours a day for a few weeks mi us the 2 days a week my wife had off. My medicine is still not even close to being right at this point. Still depressed and emotional. So finally my daughter starts getting better head control and I want to start helping more. I was tired of feeling guilty over not helping my mother in law take care of our daughter while my wife worked. When my wife was home I would prep bottles grab everything and generally do everything that didnt require me to do something that could some way hurt our daughter (thats how i thought about it at the time). So the day before our daughter was to go to my mother in laws my brother in law gets kidney problems. Hes like 23 and wants his mom to be there for him when he wakes up from minor surgery to help with kidney stones. Litterally giving me and my wife a few hours notice. Mother in law says she can still watch my daughter with me and be there for her son. I am extreamly uncomftorable with my daughter at this point because I don't want to hurt her or for her to stop breathing or something to just generally go wrong and I not know what to do. So I go to the hospital with my mother in law and she abandons me in the lobby for 3 hours alone with my daughter. Who i have almost zero hands on experiance with. I was promised this situation would not have happened. The hospitals ac is broken at least where i was left. My daughter is so little and helpless at this point and she starts crying to which i do my best to comfort her. Passerbys eventually start stopping to try and help me qith my baby obviously noticing me steuggling to comfort my daughter. Eventually a delivery nurse stops and helps me. She is concerned my daughter is over heating. Oh meanwhile my mother in law says she'll be right there at any moment when she does show up its almost 2 hours after i asked for help. Anyways as the nurse stripps my daughter down my mother in law finally shows up and we leave. My daughter was just feeling really unwell this day. Probably the worst day i could have been abandoned alone with her. Anyways my brother in law gets in the car and immediately starts calling me names. Saying how useless i am and how I have ruined his sisters life. Mind you I have known him since he was 12 years old. We have always got along and as he got older i would have considered him to be one of my better friends. Its widely known he has anger issues and is extreamly narcissistic. And he has snapped on all of his family and friends before but never me. So he is litterally screaming at me while my 2 month old daughter is screaming in agony while I basically in a mostly calm voice either agree that i am a piece of shit for not being able to take care of my daughter alone or just telling him to stop yelling and to shut up. We finally get home and i  tell him he is dead to me. I'll never talk to him again. Oh my wife has 5 siblings and i got along really well with her 4 brothers before this. I consider them family. I've known all of them as long as me and their sister had been together which is more than half their lives at this point. Even as I type this many months later I am still incredibly upset by this whole situation.  My daughter only went everyday to my mother in laws for another week before i took over completely. It took about another month to get my thyroid medicone right but once my daughter could support her own head i didnt really have an issue watching and taking care of her. My main issue was an irrational fear something would go wrong and i would be alone to deal with the situation. \n\n\nSo 6 months later and everything is perfect with my daughter I am still a stay at home dad to my 8 month old baby girl. Other than my wife and a maybe 1 to 2 days a month its just been me taking care of her everyday. Almost everyone on my wifes side stopped talking to me or at the very least no longer want to talk or hang out. Feel like i lost more than friends but a large part of my family.  I didn't go to thanksgiving or visit for Christmas. I haven't spoken to the brother in law that freaked out on me since that day but he is constantly bad mouthing me to everyone. Even though for the last 6 months I've taken really good care of my daughter. \n\nSo the question is am I the ass hole for trying to depend on my family to help take care of my daughter for the first 2 months until i was comfortable watching her on my own?",

      "description": "I'm a trans woman in her mid 20s and my gender is a big part of who I am. I've been out for a long time and I'm very open about my transition to my friends and family. I present female in public, and although I haven't had surgery, I've been on hormone therapy for years.\n\nMy relationship with my (cis) boyfriend is nearly at the 2-years mark. We're happy. But when I first met his parents, he asked me not to mention that I was trans. I agreed and he introduced me as his girlfriend. His parents had no problem using she/her pronouns and basically it's never been questioned.\n\nUnfortunately, keeping my transition a secret makes me very anxious. Nowadays his parents and I are reasonably close. We get along well. But every time I meet them, I know I can't relax. I'm worried I might make it obvious that it's a big effort to avoid looking like a man. Or that I'll somehow reveal that their son is dating a woman who (...let's be honest...) has a penis.\n\nHere's the difficult part: I'm not saying they aren't aware. I don't believe I \"pass\" perfectly and it's likely they've worked it out already. But my boyfriend feels that his parents wouldn't understand, and they could potentially think less of him (and me, but my relationship with his parents isn't so important). I personally believe they would be accepting, but I realise my boyfriend knows his parents better than I do. I could be wrong... I don't know.\n\nTldr: AITA for trying to persuade my boyfriend to let me tell his parents I'm trans (to reduce my anxiety around them) despite the risk they'll judge him for it?",

      "description": "Okay guys, this is a double AITA.\n\nFor background: We, DH (Darling Husband) &amp; I been together 12 yrs. I have 2 children from a prior. They're 2 and 8 when we met. One 6 year old together.\n\nMy MIL (mother in law) has always been manipulative &amp; is one of those people whom makes digs at you in a sickening sweet way so you cannot really confront her. She is passive aggressive. DH's family are all \"entitled white people\" of the same stereotype. \n\nI'm not, a yes bitch.\n\nFor years, my MIL at events has taken pics requesting my 2 boys to stand out of pics bc they are not \"blood family\". I let her have that but voiced my concerns to DH. He always responds, \"Mom is who she is\". Incidents like this happen all the time. But marriage is about compromise right?\n\nWell, in spring of 2017 DH's Aunt, MIL's sister, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Tough break for sure. Halloween 2017, MIL &amp; Aunt's mom (G-ma) passes away. They begin planning a trip to Michigan set for June Father's day week 2019 bc G-ma always wanted this. Fast forward Dec 2018 Aunt passes away - heartbreaking.\n\nFast forward to last week, 1.5 years of planning this trip, MIL and FIL come to visit. We have coffee with MIL whom starts naming off all the people who are going to MI to my 6 year old, only my 2 boys are left off. Thinking it's an error I say nothing. 2 days later at dinner attended by entire family and my 20 year old (other son was not there thank fucking goodness) &amp; MIL starts the same shit of all who are invited in a sing-song voice to the grandkids. My boys are left off again in front of my 20 yr old.\n\nCome to find out entire family has been planning this trip without my 2 sons. WTF? I realize they purposely left me out of planning, very unusual, so my 2 kids could not come.\n\nDH claims he had no idea, which I don't believe. We get into huge fight, he blames dead aunt &amp; says it's all her fault. Being the confrontational bitch I am, I text MIL very nicely &amp; explain I will not be going. She apologizes nicely and also blames dead aunt, I said, still not going &amp; my 2 sons &amp; I will do something else. Both women planned this trip &amp; aunt has been dead 4 months.\n\nDuring therapy this week my DH admits he lied, &amp; he knew way before me but was planning on taking all 5 of us anyway.\n\nSo my DH was going to play me like a fool &amp; take us on a vacay we were not invited on while all knew besides us? I'm beyond hurt by this. I said he looks like a pussy ass mama's boy who was planning to play his RoD for a fool over this? Then I called him a bitch &amp; said all the trust we spent the last year rebuilding is gone. AITA?\n\nI have since told him his family are selfish, narcissistic assholes who wouldn't piss on anyone if they were on fire &amp; I will have nothing to do with them ever again but I won't deny our 6 year old a relationship with them bc I'm not that sort of person. Also, I said my 14 year old will stay clueless to him being uninvited.\n\nAMITA? Did I take it too far?\n\nSorry so long!",

I heard from the two seniors that Toonboom was an absolute must-use for longer animations, and wanted to use it, and told that to my partner at the start of the project. He said about a week after that that he wanted to use photoshop and aftereffects. I continued using toonboom and probably said that he should use it too a couple times. Now we're two weeks from the due date and he still hasn't learned toonboom and it'd be an absolute pain to convert the toonboom layers to Aftereffects. I've done all the work on the toonboom file and i assume he has an aftereffects file, but i definitely have more done.

      "description": "I think almost everyone in the world can relate to roommate problems. It's always small issues, little annoying things. Knowing this, I said to my current roommate when I moved in: \"If you have an issue that's big enough to be a problem, tell me immediately. I don't want to play the game where someome gets resentful over a tiny issue.\" She agreed, and it's been generally nice. \n\nSome issues came up, and we settled them early on. But then this one comes along:\n\nI drink a lot of tea. At least one full travel mug a day. So for convenience, I keep my tea kettle, a tub of sugar, and whatever box of teabags I'm working through on an out of the way corner of the counter (away from 'workspace'). I have done this for about a year now. \n\nYesterday, I come home to this doozy: The counter's been wiped down, my tea stuff has been shoved into a cupboard. I figured maybe my roommate just forgot to put the stuff back, so I set it back out.\n\nLater she texts me saying she wants me to start keeping my stuff in the cupboards to make room on the counters, that it got in the way when she was cleaning. Apparently, she expected me to simply take the hint earlier.\n\nSo this irks me, because it's been that way for a year, and I really hate passive-aggressiveness or when people aren't direct.\n\nSo I texted back no. I prefered it the way it was and if it was a real issue it would have come up sooner. I said I already have issues getting stuff from my cupboards because it's true.\n\nBut then she texts back no, your cupboards aren't overflowing, she likes having more counter space. \n\nSo I kinda lost my temper. If it hadn't been an argument over text I might have said something really rude. \n\nI knew I was right on this small issue, and I could argue and get my way eventually. But the fact that we were having that argument at all, that she was turning this nothing into an issue after a year is what really pissed me off.\n\nSo I texted back this:\n\nIs this really an argument you want to be having? Because roommates have to deal with eachother. they deal with small minor inconveniences instead of getting bogged down by petty, stupid issues like this one. If you want to start arguing about every petty, stupid little thing that bothers somebody in this house we can get real petty, real stupid, real fast. I choose not to live that way for the sake of getting along. The least you could do is cool this neurotic outburst, and pay me the same courtesy.\n\nI am probably an asshole for calling her neurotic. In my opinion she is but it was unnecessary to say and it's just one person's opinion. \n\nI didn't want to have the same argument on something else later. I wanted to establish that if she set this precedent for issues then nobody would be having a good time. I made the choice when I moved in not to sweat the petty stuff because I would be happier and in that moment I felt like she just didn't get that and wanted to have it all.\n\nBut it was a small issue that started it. Am I overreacting?",

      "description": "Backstory: My estranged uncle (now 62) mooched off my grandparents &amp; lived with them for the first 40 some years of his life, got a warrant for his arrest, &amp; escaped to another state. 10 years later he decides to move back in with my grandparents (he was 50ish, they were 75ish) won’t work, does nothing but take advantage of his elderly parents. My mentally challenged adult aunt was also completely dependent upon my grandparents her whole life. I spent a lot of time with my grandfather &amp; we were very close.  He told me how upset my uncle made him, he was very angry &amp; extremely stressed. Due to this my grandpa died of a very sudden heart attack. I 100% blame my uncle for his death. He continued living with my grandma (severe dementia) &amp; still refused to work, clean, take care of my grandma, he didn’t even feed her or give her her meds. Rotting food in the kitchen &amp; literally shit on the bathroom floor. My dad offered to have a nurse come a few times a week to help take care of my grandma, my uncle refused. My dad would clean, mow the lawn, take out the trash, grocery shop, etc since my uncle wouldn’t. Eventually learned my uncle was stealing grandma’s social security checks, $50k from the estate &amp; valuables/family heirlooms. My grandma’s health deteriorated, my dad put her in a nursing home &amp; sold the house. My dad &amp; his siblings went to court for the remainder of the inheritance. Even though uncle stole $50k (there is legal evidence) he still wanted more $.\n\nWhen my grandmother died my family &amp; I stayed hours &amp; hours during her last days, sitting with her, dabbing her lips with a sponge, telling her stories, etc until her final breath. What does my uncle do? He walks in, grabs a sandwich, stands there eating while he looks at his mother dying, &amp; asks what we’re going to do with her furniture. His mother is literally dying in front of him &amp; he wants free furniture. He didn’t even talk to her or sit next to her. He finished his sandwich &amp; left. \n\nNow back to the newspaper article. Full front page story of my poor sad uncle being homeless &amp; sleeping in his car &amp; gosh life has been so tough on him, lies upon lies to gain public sympathy. He paints himself as a victim when all he did his entire life was take advantage of my grandparents, steal $50k &amp; social security checks, neglect my grandma with dementia, &amp; he’s been keeping my mentally challenged aunt with him in homeless shelters to get her disability checks. (We’ve tried to get her to come back to the family so she can be properly taken care of but uncle has turned her against us &amp; she refuses)\n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to write a letter to the newspaper to set the record straight?  The thought of my uncle receiving donations or taking advantage of more people makes me sick.  My dad is worried about the family reputation but IMHO he should be in jail for theft, fraud, elderly neglect, involuntary manslaughter, &amp; more. ",

      "description": "Quick context:\nThis is my first girlfriend. We've been taking for a good amount of time now and through dating her I've learned a lot about how to talk with her and deal with her. I'd say I've been a pretty good boyfriend. She's very emotional and frequently unloads her problems onto me, and I'm very grateful for that, actually, since I can often give her helpful advice and see her perk up. Otherwise just listening usually helps her. For the record, I don't mind her being emotional. \n\n\nSo recently she's been going through some more hard stuff with school getting pretty tough and she's been trying to lose weight, etc. Every few weeks, she'll get really emotional about a lot of things at once and she will chastise herself for being in these situations like being overweight, stressing over schoolwork, etc. (there are more things she typically talks about but I'm keeping it general for privacy) \n\n\nI understand that people don't always need advice. I've learned that sometimes people just need someone to listen and say \"yeah that sucks. Hope you get through it.\" The problem I've been having is that this drought of happiness for her has been lasting a much longer time than normal and I think it's pretty obvious why. I've been recommending she starts reading more, getting more sleep, exercising self-esteem raising practices, stop procrasting, stick with your diet, etc. While she doesn't seem to doubt that these things would help, she frequently blows off the advice and chops her emotional issues up to, \"Well, I'm a girl.\" Her reasoning for that, best I can tell is that she's a girl and girls are more emotional than guys. \n\n\nI try to tell her that I don't like that excuse and she knows exactly how to get back on track. I haven't told her this, but I also think it's very degrading or sexist that she's using something like her gender as an excuse for poor behavior. I am assuming that this is just a rough few months and eventually she'll be stable again and we can talk about her excuse. As of now, she really hates it when I try to say that her excuse is a poor one. Sure, being a girl probably scientifically makes her more susceptible to overwhelming emotions (especially during certain weeks) but this is beyond that now. I think that her self-destructive behavior is either a defense mechanism for something I don't know about, or because she's got some reason for not wanting to work to fix her problems. (Fear, laziness, etc.) \n\n\nI want nothing more than her to be happy again and I see this reason/excuse as a stumbling block to her getting real help. AITA for saying I don't like her excuse and that it's a cop-out and WIBTA if I continue telling her that? \n\n\n\n(obligatory throwaway bc my girlfriend uses reddit, also on mobile so sorry about formatting) ",

      "description": "Throwaway account for this. For the record none of this is anything I haven't also said to men I know as well.\n\nI spent the majority of my life in very harsh socioeconomic conditions surrounded by crime and was involved either directly or indirectly in a lot of not so good stuff. I thankfully managed to escape that life and make something of myself but I've never really forgotten my experiences and have a lot of \"street smarts\" that some people never had to develop. I used that to get a career in security.\n\nAs a result I'm very safety-oriented. I make sure the door is locked, I make sure to check the backseat, I make sure to be aware of my surroundings. Nothing tinfoil hat level, just basic stuff. \n\nMy girlfriend had a completely opposite upbringing and had a *very* sheltered life in an upper class area before moving to our city. She can be a bit naive, if I'm being honest. She recently went to a party to which she walked alone to meet a friend blocks away from her house through one of the worst areas in our city at night. I also deduced that she left her drink unattended multiple times and went alone in a car with 3 guys she never met to get stuff from a store.\n\nWhen I heard this I was worried. I didn't yell or get upset with her, but I did tell her my concerns because she literally said she didn't see how it could be dangerous. She accused me of being an r word (damn word filter) apologist, saying it's not her fault if something happens, how she shouldn't have to do this and that, etcetera.\n\nI agree in an ideal world she shouldn't have to, none of us should. But I explained to her that bad guys don't care if you deserve it, they take advantage of people. I'd be equally worried if my brother did that. In a perfect world I should be able to count my money in a back alley, but bad people exist. Is that our fault? No, but I should avoid behavior that leaves me at increased risk because getting victimized is getting victimized regardless of who is at fault. It's not because she's a woman, I'm a big guy, I wouldn't even leave my drink unattended or walk alone in high crime areas at night. Shit happens.\n\nI tried to tell her that I want her to have fun and wouldn't blame her for the behavior of others, I just don't want anything to happen to her because I've seen what can happen. I asked that she have a friend watch her drink or accompany her in those areas, or at least be on the phone with someone. In my mind, just normal safety stuff. She's not having any of it. Am I wrong for suggesting this?I've had this conversation with other friends, both men and women, and none have taken offense before. I know I can't \"control\" her before anyone piles on, I don't want to. I just wanted to offer some tips.",

And the best? She dropped out of uni after 4 months and never went to her apartment, but my mom still had to pay for it and she still refused to get a job to help pay.\n\nAnother thing, now she works and feels like she NEED a car, not for driving directly to her work, but to the train station which is like a big 30 minutes walk that I do nearly everyday. So she have her car. My mom's second car. And she doesn't pay anything for it. She doesn't even want to clean the car, it became a huge mess :(\n\nRecently, my sister took lessons in general well being, aromatherapy, massage, Feng shui etc and she believes it completely changed her, when in fact, it didn't.\nRecently she tried to be kind to me, but I just had enough, I don't want to be kind to her after everything she did to me and my family, she says that I get mad over ridiculous things, but all the help she had, I can't have it, I have to work all the time to be able to pay my studies, I can't have a car, I can't even pay the lessons for my driving license, I have to do everything alone (and it's not my mom's fault, she does everything she can, and I refuse to be a burden like my sister was for her, but I must say, I'm a bit jealous). \n\nI'm just done with her, and I don't want to be suddenly kind when SHE decide that things have changed, maybe later, but I need time. \nI'm still not over the years of her mean behavior, but for her, I'm a \"selfish girl who doesn't want to make thing easier for the family\" when she is the one making it hard. So, yeah, AITA? \n\nTL;DR: Sister who have been a spoiled ass all of her life says I'm selfish for not accepting her sudden \"Change of behavior fort the best\" when in reality, she didn't change at all.

      "title": "AITA for thanking the dog back home when my grandma wanted to take him for a walk?",
      "description": "So, here's the backstory: my brother's dog, small mix of some kind, is a little fluff of love. He runs up to everyone and throws himself on back for belly rubs. He likes playing and maximum contact, like sitting in our laps or nibbling hands as plea to pet him. He listens to basic commands like sit, come, and good boy, and he's one and a half years old.\n\nOn the other side, outside, he's like another dog. He's not agressive, but boy is he unresponsive to commands. He would only listen if I stop, and keep standing for a few seconds, then he'll look at me and sit if I tell him to. And that would be over the moment I step forward. He's usually fine while going back home, unless he deemed half an hour of walkies not enough, so he might pull leash few times, but give in in the end. I often volounteer and enjoy to take him out when I go to their place, or if they leave us the dog when they leave their kids for sitting, so they also leave leash with him.\n\nThe only two persons he listens to fully are my brother and my SIL. He would be obedient to everyone if you were to give him some meat, kinds fine if only pets are in the game, but I repeat - especially outside, he's like another dog.\n\nSo today, my mom and grandma were talking about how he needed to pee because he followed grandma to the door. (He follows anyone who talks to him because he thinks it's play time.) So they start to tease him, saying out loud \"do you wanna go outside\" etc, and he starts to get kinda excited, but the thing is - his main cue is seeing his leash, that's when he properly goes nuts without turning back. So it wasn't _that much_ needed, really.\n\nSo I hear a commotion outside of my room, I go out and there I see my grandma tied some random elastic rope around his chest, but in a circle, so the moment he goes forward he would be out of it. It didn't make any sense. So I go out, and try to explain her.\n\nThe thing is, she doesn't want to listen. I tell her \"no no, stop for just a second, listen\" and she looks up to me so I say \"the moment he starts to run, he will be out of your improvised leash, you can't take him out like that\" and I said this in the most compassionate tone I had in me, but she cut me midsentence and tried to open the door.\n\nDog was tapping in excitement in this moment. I was leaning on door and keeping them closed, still telling my grandma, that no, this is not a good idea _because the dog won't listen, especially without a leash_ but all I get was a shove (not a hard one, I mean, but it hurt emotionally coming from her), so she manages to open the door, and it happened so fast I didn't even see when it happened - but the dog was out of his improvised \"leash\".\n\nHe's a little fluffy flash, so he was down the stairs in a second. Grandma goes after him, slowly. So I go back inside, I put my shoes on, go down one flight of stairs, and they were on the main door to the building, and I tell grandma one more time not to open the door, but she put her hand on the handle, so I do the only thing in that moment that I could - I take our dog under my hand, and go back home. I only put him down when I was sure our home door were closed.\n\nSo she comes minute or two after me, and doesn't try to take him out again.\n\nI told my mom story almost as it happened, and she asked me why did I reacted that way, after all _he might've come back_. (Her exact words.) So I told her \"might\" and \"maybe\" weren't enough for me to let him go out without a leash, and without a collar and tag for that matter.\n\nThis was dropped. So after, SIL and brother woke up, and grandma told them this story, how she wanted to do them a favor of taking him out, because our neighbor does this, just let's her dog make few circles around our park, and it comes back - but this dog is a poodle with different temperament that might've been professionally trained, is 5-7 years old, and lives every day with this woman, while our dog only sees us once a week at best, and can't even listen to my SIL when they're outside, even though she's the person he loves the most. (I must stress that this is well known in our family.)\n\nSIL says he's pain in the ass when outside, he goes nuts when he sees other dogs and who knows what might've happened - so it was better this way. It wasn't urgent, he was out 3-4 hours prior. Grandma tells ok, fair enough.\n\nSo they leave, and while I don't eavesdrop, they talked loudly enough so I can hear grandma saying to my mom how she won't speak with me now, how I belittled her and underestimated her, how this is basically it between us.\n\nI go upset to my mom, and ask her wtf is that all about, and EVEN SHE IS NOW angry with me, even though she primarily stayed at least neutral. She told me I should've explained nicely, and I tell her how I did but I got shoved in return, and she basically shrugged. And is still mad.\n\nTL;DR - Grandma wanted to take out our dog who doesn't yet behave and listens to commands (especially outside) without a leash, and proceeded to do so even when I told her as nicely as I could how that isn't a good idea. So I just picked him up, and brought him back inside. \n\nNow I feel crazy for the whole situation, and I ask you Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So me and this guy have been best friends for almost a decade. We've gone through a lot together and we have a really strong relationship. During the summer he moved to another country because he got into a University there, and recently he asked me if he could crash in my house for a few days while he was visiting, because his family had moved elsewhere. Of course, me and my family were happy to let him stay, we really love his company.\n\nNow, I play football, and take it very seriously (I'd like to be pro), and this weekend we had a really crucial game (top of the table clash), and I assumed he'd be coming to watch and support me/my team, since he was living with me. We even talked about it and it really sounded like he was coming. However, I then found out that he wasn't coming, and was instead going to watch a football match of his favourite team. I don't know how long he's had the ticket for, but, like I said, we spoke several times before he travelled and he was speaking like he intended to come to my game.\n\nI'm not gonna say anything, so maybe I'm not exactly the asshole, but am I overreacting or being hypocritical?

      "description": "Me and my dad have always been close and had a decent father-daughter relationship. I'm 31 (f) and recently married with no kids. My dad is very set in his ways about doctors and how \"useless\" they are. He hadn't been to one in a very long time, save the last two weeks. In my adult life my dad has had all sorts of \"bathroom issues\" having to pee very frequently and urgently. In the past few weeks it has gotten so bad and painful that he actually broke down and went to urgent care and asked for some antibiotics that have done nothing. I'm thinking the issue is probably more prostate involved and me and my mom have been tip-toeing around the subject with him and trying to convince him he NEEDS to see a doctor. He gets upset when either me or my mom bring it up now. Me and my husband want to wait another 5 years or so before we have kids but it would be so devastating if he wasn't around to meet them and be in their lives. \n\nWIBTA if I told him \"Dad you need to go to a doctor or else you won't be around to meet your grandkids?\" I know this is a sensitive subject but I'm hoping something like this might motivate him to seek help.",

I understand why she does it, because she cares and wants to help with my anxiety issues. She told me that \"You didn't know how to deal with your dad's death when you were 3 and it's the ultimate cause for your social anxiety now.\" I was annoyed because I know this is false as I'm the one experiencing it and it certainly is not the cause for my anxiety, probably a very, very minor part of it or none at all. I then told her that I don't care for the effects of my father's death. For me, there's little effect. I never really knew the man and was too young to have a real relationship with him. I of course miss the opportunity of having a father, but not him himself. I think my opinion on his death is just, but my mother has a hard time accepting it being she was his wife. ",

I did nothing about it. The chemistry between us was great though, better than anyone else's in the group. The closer I got to her, the less i cared about the fact that she had a boyfriend. Him and I were not close at all, barely talked to each other. He was concerned with how close me and her were, friends informed me.\n\n  \nFast forward a couple months after meeting them, I can start to tell that her boyfriend is kinda a shithead. I bring it up to multiple people in the group. They all tell me to just be cool, \"he isn't all that bad\". The more that I find out about their relationship, usually through friends in the group, the more inclined I am to tell this girl how I feel. So eventually one night, I do. She feels the same way. We talk about her leaving him and trying us, but that ended up going nowhere. I drop it all, knowing this could cause harm to our friend group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month passes, and she was giving me a ride home from a party at a friends house. Once we get to my house, she tells me she wants me. She says shes been thinking about \"it\" all weekend. I tell her i'm not doing anything with her if she is still with her boyfriend. She explains that its not that easy, and we talk for close to an hour. This ends up with us talking in circles, she leaves and i figure that's the end of the night. A hour or two later, i hear my doorbell. Its her. She tells me she did it, she broke up with him. So I let her in.\n\nLaying in bed afterwards she confesses she lied. That she didn't break it off. At that point i'm surprised, but not mad at her. We talk it through, how i wont tell anyone what happened and neither will she.  \n\n\nToday, months after we hooked up, the group is in a uproar. They found out that her boyfriend cheated on her. Now everyone thinks hes an asshole, they kick him out of the group. They all start ripping him apart, and pretty much shit on his life. All the meanwhile i'm sitting there knowing what she did first. \n\nAITA for pursing anything with her to begin with? Is she the asshole for playing innocent? Should i keep what her and I did a secret? Are they assholes for jumping ship on him, after defending him to my criticisms?   \n\n\n  ",

We took the kids to a swamp where you can get in a boat and see alligators. There are also just some alligators around the property just like chilling.

My wife and I have always shaken our heads in disbelief at people who get out to take pictures of the bears in the smokies.\n\nI started freaking out because I felt like my kids were in danger. I asked her to bring them back, and she shrugged it off and said they were fine. Then I told her to bring them away from it. Then some people at the swamp that were walking around started telling me that the gator won’t attack them and they grew up around them just fine. I started getting angry telling her to bring the damn kids away from the alligator.\n\nEventually she did, but I was super pissed for the rest of the day. I don’t know if it’s pride, but she still maintains I overreacted and even everyone there thought I was.

      "description": "I have oral allergy syndrome (OAS). Essentially I am mildly allergic to certain raw fruits, vegetables and nuts. When I eat these foods I usually get an itchy mouth while I'm eating them which goes away quickly once they leave my mouth.\n\nIt's not medically threatening at all, at it's worst sometimes I will get slightly swollen/burning lips (like eating something with hot chilli).\n\nCooking any of these foods means I can eat them fine and if I do eat raw ones, it's not a big deal.\n\nHowever I normally don't explain this to people, I just tell them I am allergic to the foods and can't eat them (regardless of whether the meal is cooked or not) as I don't like most of these foods anyway. I am aware that most of these people think I am deadly allergic and I let them think that.\n\nI've also used this pretty often in arguments in the past. Recently at a family dinner I told my SIL I couldn't eat any of her cooking because I am allergic, I really didn't like any of the food she cooked but I wasn't lying as some of it does contain ingredients I'd be allergic to. This led to an argument at the event. I also told others that I couldn't eat any of the food at their house because of my allergies when explaining the argument we had over food.\n\nI've been told that this was an asshole move, knowingly letting others think I am deadly allergic when in reality it is a mild inconvenience at worst.\n\nAITA? I am technically allergic so I don't think it is wrong, I haven't actually lied.",

Not normal screaming, like holy shit this person is going to blow out their voice type of screaming. It really freaked me out. I heard all kinds of banging. I honestly didn't know who it was and I was scared. I really thought an insane person broke into our house and obviously I wasn't going to go down stairs to check it I didn't want to get murdered, so I hid under my bed and called 911. I stayed on the phone with the lady until the cops came. It didn't take them long to get there. I guess because I told them it was an intruder a bunch of cops pulled up guns drawn ready to go. They talked to my mom and me separately for like 30 minutes then they left. My mom was pissed at me and said she can scream and slam doors because it's her g&amp;ddamn house this that and the third. \n\nLike, okay, valid but I literally didn't know it was my mom and I tried to have a reasonable conversation with her and she just kept flipping the f%ck out on me. I don't even know what she was so mad about? She literally would not tell me why. I know she has a stressful job she's an ARNP and I know she has like anger problems sometimes but I've never seen her this mad. She told me to go to my uncle, her brother's, house for the weekend because she didn't want to even look at me. It's not even a punishment lol my cousin and me are like brother and sister lol. I'd rather be here than with my mom honestly. :/",

I feel bad cutting and so I asked them, “hey a table outside is open, did you still want it?” My friend gets annoyed, yells “let’s go”, and without waiting, hurries outside to claim the table. She later says to me that “it’s not her problem” that they didn’t move fast enough. \n\nIt really turned me off to this friend.

      "description": "So the title is a very condensed version of what happened.\nTldr: friend Alex asked me to watch a kitten for two weeks that quickly turned into a month and a half so I cut off contact now a month later Alex is in my inbox yelling at me. \n\nIn November I got back from a two week trip over seas and a friend we'll call Alex messaged and asked if I would watch her kitten Remy for two weeks so she could get the mom to stop producing milk. Since I was already taking my girl Moony from Alex I said sure bring them both (note I do not drive).\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving Alex and her three boys show up and drop off the kitten, three hours after they said they would but not a huge deal because I was off work and I know its about an hour drive from my place to hers. I confirm again that it's only for two weeks and she'll pick her up in early December. Alex agrees and reminds me to spend lots of time with them both to make sure I'm keeping the right one (at the time I just knew I was keeping one, not which of the two girls it would be).\n\nAbout a week later I tell Alex that Moony will be stay with me and she says that's great, she'll come get Moony the following weekend.\n\nThe weekend she's supposed to pick Remy up she texts that something came up and it'll have to be postponed but this time she doesn't give me a date. Whatever the girls are happy and I'm falling in love with both.\n\nFast forward to the last weekend in December and Alex messages me asking what I'm doing for my bday on the ninth and I tell her probably just staying in and snuggling Moony. At this point she tells me I'll still have Remy then too, a little more than a month after Remy was supposed to go home. I think about it and then text her back that in that case I think I'd just like to keep both cats because they've bonded to me and each other and I don't want to separate them.\n\nCue the sob story about how her oldest misses his cat and wants her back and she's promised she will get Remy back soon. Mind you up until this point I've initiated all contact about the cats and sent updates, Alex has never been the first to message me about them.\n\nSo from here on I stop messaging first, I stop sharing pics of the girls where Alex can see them, and I rename Remy to Siri. Life goes on and about a month (early February) after that last convo I unfriend Alex on fb because I see no reason to keep up the charade of us being friends if she won't message me first.\n\nNow three weeks later Alex messages me that I'm an a-hole for kidnapping her cat and breaking her boys heart. She also called me a fake friend and said this was my plan all along, even though I was doing her a favor by even taking one cat in the first place (I didn't want a three month old kitten, I was planning on adopting one from a shelter that was at least a year old).\n\nSo am I the a-hole here?",

My dad is a very controlling and arrogant person. The simple way to describe life with him is “it’s his way or you’re a fucking asshole” this is the unfortunate truth to the matter. \n\nNo matter what you’re talking about my dad HAS to be right about it, and will argue with you until one of 2 things happen, 1- he gets so angry that you’re arguing with him he starts yelling at you(which won’t take long) or you give up and start to yes him to death until the topic is dropped(this will take long) \n\nHe also has a need to influence every possible thing going on, wether it be my hairstyle or the way I keep my sideburns, or what I should be doing in my life in the future, the point is that he likes to make sure that people understand who’s in charge. \n\nSo when things don’t go his way, when he’s wrong about something and it’s proven so, whether it’s about small semantic type things (his favorite thing to argue about) or larger more hot bed topics, I take joy in his frustration because to be honest, he needs every serving of humble pie he gets. \n\nSo AITA for enjoying when things don’t go his way and he doesn’t get his desired outcome?

      "description": "Throwaway, because reasons. Long story short, I got invited to play with a friend's friend group and apparently, I hit it off with them... too well? According to the original friend that invited me, this is me stealing their new friend group away. Will be posting a chat excerpt for context. AITA?\n\n(LNS) = Literal, not sarcastic.  \nLightly edited for anonymity.\n\n \n\nMe Today at 1:11 AM These are okay peoples. I like them.    \nThem Today at 1:11 AM that's good    \nThem Today at 2:06 AM are you stealing my friends now    \nMe Today at 2:07 AM What?    \nThem Today at 2:07 AM are you stealing them you can't steal what I don't have    \nMe Today at 2:07 AM They are playing other games.    \nThem Today at 2:07 AM and you're just sitting there?    \nMe Today at 2:10 AM Yup, chatting.    \nThem Today at 2:17 AM you're stealing my friends    \nMe Today at 2:18 AM Am not.    \nThem Today at 2:19 AM You are    \nThem Today at 2:30 AM okay well enjoy my friends, I'll go find new ones    \nMe Today at 3:05 AM Wait. I can't tell if you're actually upset that I decided to spend some time with them after you left.  Them Today at 3:06 AM Yes I am You always get along with them better than I do and then I lose them after that    \nMe Today at 3:06 AM I am confuse.  \nThem Today at 3:07 AM I work really hard to enter the circle and you're in there for 5 mins and boom you're everyone's friend and everyone likes you more   \nMe Today at 3:09 AM I don't think it's really a case of who likes who more. It's just a matter of people playing games. We play games with friends to have fun. I'm not trying to \"steal them away from you\"    \nThem Today at 3:10 AM Doesn't matter. I'm probably gonna find them playing with you more often and then I get forgotten like always Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to find a group to fit into   \nMe Today at 3:11 AM I'm... sorry I'm me? (LNS) I'm not sure what I was supposed to do. Be a horrible person, so you look better in comparison? (LNS)  \nThem Today at 3:12 AM You don't get it do you      \nMe Today at 3:12 AM Not... really.      \nThem Today at 3:12 AM Whatever I'm better off alone anyways      \nMe Today at 3:16 AM Would you like to explain what it is, then, so I can understand?      \nThem Today at 3:17 AM I already explained it as best as I could and you didnt understand it   \nMe Today at 3:17 AM What would you have liked me to have done instead?   \nThem Today at 3:18 AM I should have played with you guys separately   \nMe Today at 3:18 AM What would you have liked ME to do, differently?      \nThem Today at 3:19 AM Nothing you could have done really the fact that you're a dude and you make stupid jokes already means you one up me in their eyes  \nMe Today at 3:19 AM I think you might be putting yourself down a little bit. To me, that sounds like you feel like you just want to be the token girl gamur in their group. And I don't think you're that low at all.   \nMe Today at 3:20 AM I think you're much better than that.  \nThem Today at 3:20 AM I have to work twice as hard to get that kind of respect      \nMe Today at 3:20 AM I don't think saying thank you for the carry, when I was carrying was really \"sucking my dick\". If someone carried me, I'd thank them too. And I don't think I'd need to say nohomo for it.      \nThem Today at 3:21 AM Oh wow you sweep in to clean up and you're the most fed yet strongest yay carry That's not the fucking point I've done shit akin to that and i don't get half the praise you do      \nMe Today at 3:21 AM Okay, well, what IS the point to you? I genuinely don't understand then.      \nThem Today at 3:21 AM I do stupid jokes like you and all I get is sighs No one laughs like they did with you Don't try to tell me that I want to be a token girl I want fucking friends and you always outshine me      \nMe Today at 3:24 AM I'm... Sorry??? (Very confus.)  \nThem Today at 3:24 AM See it doesn't matter how many times I explain it you still don't understand It's like as soon as you came in there I was no longer important It doesn't matter how much time I put into people I'm still not important So like I said enjoy them, I'll have to find new ones      \nMe Today at 3:26 AM I don't think just because I spent time with them means you're unimportant to them.    \nThem Today at 3:27 AM I've done shit akin to that and i don't get half the praise you do I do stupid jokes like you and all I get is sighs No one laughs like they did with you Nothing you could have done really the fact that you're a dude and you make stupid jokes already means you one up me in their eyes I should have played with you guys separately Here cause it's 1am and I'm not writing different versions of these for the next 2 hours      \nMe Today at 3:29 AM I really do think you're basically throwing yourself under the bus here.  \nThem Today at 3:29 AM And how is that? How?   \nMe Today at 3:29 AM You're basically thinking you're not important because these people made a new friend.      \nThem Today at 3:30 AM Yes they met you for 5 fucking minutes and they get along with you better than with me and I've met them for over a month I could barely even fucking speak by the time you were in the game since you were all talking and interrupting each other I feel knocked into the corner for the shiny new toy   \nMe Today at 3:31 AM I mean, I got interrupted a fair bit, but if I wanted to say something, I asserted myself after someone was finished with their statement.      \nThem Today at 3:31 AM I CANT DO THAT CAUSE NONE OF YOU FUCKING LISTEN   \nMe Today at 3:31 AM I mean, obviously it works if I can do it. Why can't you? (LNS)      \nThem Today at 3:31 AM Because I'm a fucking woman   \nMe Today at 3:32 AM So... what you're saying is that these people are sexist?   \nThem Today at 3:32 AM If I assert myself I'm a bitch and I need to calm down You can do it and everyone goes silent    \nMe Today at 3:32 AM I honestly doubt that.   \nThem Today at 3:32 AM Im Okay Don't listen to me You know best      \nMe Today at 3:32 AM IF that were the case, I don't think those are people you'd like to hang out with anyway.  \nThem Today at 3:32 AM Do you understand??? How desperate I am for friends????? That I'm with these people???? Do you see it?????      \nMe Today at 3:33 AM I mean, from my understanding, you basically just theory crafted the worse possible outcome, no matter how unlikely.      \nThem Today at 3:33 AM I have to yell at them and put them in their place every week but for fucks sake at least I have company I'm I don't want to be alone      \nMe Today at 3:33 AM I don't either. But I've learned something.      \nThem Today at 3:33 AM You have your own fucking friends   \nMe Today at 3:34 AM I need to be happy and content with being myself.      \nThem Today at 3:34 AM I don't even have best friends      \nMe Today at 3:34 AM And happy with who I am first.      \nThem Today at 3:34 AM You have Person A and Person B and all those other fucks I have no one   \nMe Today at 3:34 AM I mean, Person B has devolved into hating himself, alcoholism and racing games. And Person A is too busy with work and being an adult. And I'm not social enough to make new friends.     \nThem Today at 3:35 AM But for the last fucking time don't take my friends Don't      \nMe Today at 3:35 AM I'm not.  \nThem Today at 3:35 AM You go find some But don't take those      \nMe Today at 3:35 AM I'm literally not trying to take your friends.      \nThem Today at 3:35 AM Don't take what little I have      \nMe Today at 3:35 AM I just wanted to play games with them because they were there. I feel like I'm being accused for something that's not my fault and that's not a good feeling.      \nThem Today at 3:37 AM You have the most biggest tendency to meet my friends and take them don't do it this time I've lost many friends due to that      \nMe Today at 3:37 AM I don't get what you mean. All the friends that have stayed are still with you. Those that left aren't with me. I haven't \"taken\" anyone.      \nThem Today at 3:38 AM And I can count those on one hand I really just should have played with you guys separately I should have known I'm fucking stupid      \nMe Today at 3:39 AM I'm sorry for how you feel right now, but I honestly don't get it. I don't think I've done anything wrong. I wish I could make you feel better.   \nThem Today at 3:39 AM I did the thing wrong. I combined all you fucks together knowing how bad that mix has been before I didnt want to ignore you and I didnt want to leave them So I did the nice person thing and joined you all together and it bit me in the ass     \nMe Today at 3:41 AM I feel like you feel like I'm doing something to wrong you.      \nThem Today at 3:41 AM I feel like I was stupid enough to join you all together  \nMe Today at 3:41 AM Do you think that I've wronged you somehow?      \nThem Today at 3:42 AM I feel like I was stupid enough to join you all together   \nMe Today at 3:42 AM That's... great, but not the question I asked.      \nThem Today at 3:42 AM I think that I was stupid enough to join you all together That's what I think      \nMe Today at 3:45 AM Do you think that I've wronged you, though? That's what I'm asking.      \nThem Today at 3:45 AM No I think that I was stupid to combine you all together that's all I've been saying Cause now I have no fucking friends and what's the point when an outsider can befriend them much easier than I can   \nMe Today at 3:46 AM What do you mean you have no friends? It's not like they're going to be like \"No, you're not my friend\" anymore.",

      "title": "AITA for not having adopted cats from a shelter or rescue (yet)?",
      "description": "I understand the title is a bit strange, but if you make it through the wall of text, I hope it will make sense.\n\n**TL;DR** I want 2 kittens as pets, and some things have been said to me that make me wonder if I am an asshole in the way I am going about it.\n\n**Background (relevant to the comments that have me pondering on my assholishness):** 8 years ago, I got 2 beautiful kitties within a month of each other. They were both found abandoned on different sides of the state, and the people that found them could not keep them, so I drove to meet them and took them in. We spent 5 wonderful years together before I had to move across the country, for a job opportunity that, despite being my dream job, meant lots of traveling and pretty irregular schedules. Since the cats had also bonded with my parents, they stayed back and now live happily on the East Coast. I have thought many times about bringing them over, but they are so absolutely adored by my parents, and they are spoiled to death… it just feels it would be cruel to separate them now :( \n\n**Current situation:** I decided 4 months ago to adopt again, and have have yet to find a pair that I like, feel connected to etc. I have subscribed to several local shelters and rescues, passed a home check, and get updates when new cats that match my criteria are brought in. Most of the cats however are either older (or old), can’t be with another cat in the house, have health issues, or by the time I find them they are already adopted. \n\nThe last one makes me happy in a way since it means my area is very active and caring, but I have cursed my bad timing more than once when I see the cutest most perfect bonded pair available and by the time I apply and make it to the shelter, they are already in the process of getting adopted by someone else.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to find two kittens (pair or separate) that I have absolutely fallen in love with, or otherwise been crazy enthused to adopt yet. I have thought about it for a while, and based on my previous experience, this is what I have landed on:\n\n* I want kittens or young cats. I want to see them grow and grow old myself with them. Finding older cats that are in bonded pairs, or get along well with other cats is more difficult, plus I also want cats that are energetic! \n\n* I want healthy cats. I know as they get older, they will start having health issues, as will I, but I would like to deal with these issues when they come, and not from the get-go.\n* I want either a bonded pair, or 2 kittens that get along well with other cats. From what I have been told, young kittens need to socialize with other cats, and adopting them in pairs, or existing bonded pairs, is good for their development. It also helps as I still sporadically work long hours, and they can keep each other company until I get home. \n\n* I don’t particularly care about the breed, but I would like cats with short hair that mostly stays on them (and for my second wish, genie, I want to win the lottery). I definitely don’t want a Sphynx cat though.\n\nJust to be clear, I do not want to buy a cat from a kitten mill (is this how they’re called, similar to puppy mills? are they even a thing? anyway you get the point). I am also not die-hard determined to adopt from any one shelter, or any shelter at all. If someone finds an abandoned pair of cats that I really like on the side of the road, and they don’t want to take them to a shelter, I will happily foster them and go through due process to ensure they are free for me to own. If someone’s cat gives birth and the owners can’t keep all the kitties, I will be first in line. What I’m getting at is, I will get my kittens from wherever they are available to me, shelter, roadside, family, but will avoid kitty mills (again I apologize, I am not sure what the proper phrase for this is).\n\n**Issue at hand:** I have 2 friends that are both cat people. They have told me, individually from one another, that I am an asshole for having preferences for my pets, and a double asshole for waiting for so long and not adopting a cat from a shelter/rescue already when so many are available. They claim that me having these “requirements” just shows I am not truly interested and fully committed to being a cat owner, and the fact that I “abandoned my cats for a job opportunity” shows I am selfish and never really cared about them. When I shut that down and called them out for that comment, their response was “prove it, just go into a shelter and get any cat” (???). They claim if I don’t like any of the cats in the shelters, I am a snob, and not looking to adopt a pet for the pet itself, but for myself (I don’t even know what that means, of course I am looking to adopt a pet for myself?). They also claim that only adopting pets from shelters is the right way to go, and me being willing to adopt cats from existing cat owners is despicable, should be illegal, and I am the scum of the earth for not having a problem with that.\n\nI was conflicted beforehand because, as much as I do want to adopt a pet, I don’t just want to get ANY cats, I want to at least feel attracted to them in some way, feel some kind of connection, and I don’t know if that’s a valid reason to be holding off for so long. I also want the kitties to get along. I don’t know if me wanting a pet “for myself” is actually that cuntishly selfish - I admit I don’t want to adopt a cat simply to save the cat from “a life in a shelter” (?). I want to adopt two kitties to keep me company, to love and provide for and play with and care for. I don’t even know if 4 months is “too long” to be looking, and I should just go back and get the first bonded pair of kittens available, and I will grow to love them in time...\n\nSo, I don’t know, am I really an asshole here?",

      "description": "I'll start with the fact my boyfriend is too good for me. I'm 21, a highschool dropout, have never had a job and likely never will because of various illnesses. I can't cook, be social, leave the house alone, drive, I'm very nonfunctional. I'm pretty useless in society and have accepted that. But my boyfriend is an amazing person. He tries to help everyone, is never mean or angry, he is honestly a good person.\n\nI've got about 3 things I'm better at. He is better than me in almost every single way. My biggest achievment on something we both work on is Pokemon Go. (I really enjoyed playing it because in the summer I'd walk around my town and the sunlight would make me feel better and helped me deal with my plethora of mental illnesses.) I'm a level above him and doing slightly better, but it's been a bitch. I live in a small town that started out with 2 stops and no gym and that didn't change until a few months ago. For the first 2 years I worked with 2 stops and that's it. I never got money or raids, I worked hard to get to where I am, which isn't actually that far. I took a break from the game and got back into it with him.\n\nMy problem is he bought 2,500 coins to \"keep up with me\" but he's literally a level below me. He has 9 incubators going at all times whilst I have 1. He never runs out of pokeballs or potions or lucky eggs or incense. I feel like all my hard work is worth less than $30, cause that's all it took for him to surpass me in every way.\n\nI try really hard to cope with the fact that I will never be good enough for him and I do that by thinking of how I can actually be helpful. Pokemon Go was the only way I was ever of any use and now that's gone AND I feel like my work is invalidated.\n\nHe said if I'm upset about the cost then I should be upset about the gas, but I'm not upset about the cost. I'm upset that he got so many coins and I spent months working my way up, never having a single coin. He's got over twice as many coins as I've EVER had and also has a lot more opportunity to play (2 gyms and 4 pokestops in the small town he lives in, plus he can drive whilst I don't have my license or vehicle. It's rural Saskatchewan, so this time of year you can't go walking around with your hands out of your pockets.) I will add that with my plethora of mental illnesses I've already got extreme inadequacy issues that I work hard to control but don't always succeed. \n\nAs I've said, I can't have a job. I never had the option to just buy coins and I likely never will. He just took a massive step forward that I can't keep up with. Am I the asshole for having a meltdown over this?  I just feel like all the fun of the game and all my effort and achievements have been invalidated. ",

      "description": "Firstly let me preface by saying that this is not something I take lightly. I am the person who cries at seeing all the dogs that have been surrendered to shelters, I want to find her a home, not just dump her somewhere\n\nMy husband and I have a 1.5 year old terrier/dachshund mix named Rose. Coincidentially she turned one the day our son was born. So right now we have a 9 month son, live in an apartment, I am currently pregnant and both work full time 8-5. My husband also Ubers after work for extra money to pay for daycare and stuff, he usually gets home around midnight and he travels out of town for work 4-6 times a year.\n\nThis means he does take her out in the mornings (when he's in town) but in the afternoons I have to take her out after spending the entire day in a kennel. It didn't use to be a problem before we had a baby, but with a baby, I have to pick him up from daycare, spend time with him (reading, playing, getting him ready for bed, bathe him) by myself. Make dinner and prepare lunches and bottles for the next day. I usually end up going to bed around 11pm and don't always see my husband at night. \n\nWhen the weather is nice, I CAN get the baby in a sling and we can both walk the dog, but it has been cold or raining and most of the time I just open the door and she runs down 3 flights of stairs does her business and comes back. I don't like doing this because she's unsupervised, who knows what she could run into out there and if she poops there is no one there to pick up. Yes, I agree, it's completely irresponsible and trashy. If I don't take her out or if she comes back without pooping, she does have accidents inside and while I 100% blame myself for this, I still do not like there being dog waste on the carpet as my son will soon start crawling and I'd like it to be clean.\n \nDue to finances she has only had one round of shots, and has not been neutered. We do put on good flea medicine monthly, but that is about it for her healthcare.\n\nI like Rose. She is so smart, a quick learner, my son loves looking at her and my husband has always loved dogs and has always had at least one in the whole time I've known him.\n\nEvery time I bring up that we should find her a home, which I've been doing since I found out I was pregnant, my husband gets really angry and sad and doesn't see my reasoning. He says he works so much and the least I could do is take care of the dog.\n\nI just don't think it's a good time for us to have a dog. We don't care for her the way we should, both by dedicating time or by caring for her health. I feel it would be better for her to live with someone who can better dedicate the time and money, and once our kids are older, and are more financially able to we can get another dog.\n\nTL;DR - Due to having a baby, little time and financial struggles I think we should find our dog a home so she can have a better life but my husband disagrees",

He's started using dishes and pans more, which is 100% fine, but he constantly leaves it dirty for days within the tiny kitchen. I've asked him MULTIPLE times to clean up his dishes.\n\nToday, he left a plate in the sink. Didn't needed to be soaked or anything. I got super fed up and so I put it in front of his door.

      "description": "My friend John Doe [30] decides to become Jane Doe. He wants it to be a legit ID reveal party to see support in his decision. \n\nHe thinks the whole thing should work like a bachelor party where we take him out, and had requested Vegas. I told him today that I feel like this scenario describes any other time we go out: step one, John Doe gets too drunk. Step two: John flirts with straight or gay men at a highly annoying and pushy level. Step three: John is rejected and begins to make a scene to the victim or later to us while he (usually) cries. On top of that, he wants us to pay the tab and shared that he’s always wanted to stay at Caesar’s Palace, and while it’s not entirely out of a spontaneous budget, it certainly doesn’t sound fun in the least since I don’t gamble or visit strip clubs like him, only one of our group does that stuff with John. That’s what I had for an excuse, and his brother ends up coming over to my house today to let me know I’m an asshole. \n\nA brief background: John has had this bar meltdown multiple times, specifically after he told us he liked men. The history between us shouldn’t be a mystery here. I have only recently begun to accept homosexuality after seeing a rational friend come out to our circle. Gender identity is something I’m not bending a knee for, it is absurd from my perspective. I feel like John has always needed to have attention, but the more he falls into this sexuality and gender identity crisis, the more he needs to be heard. Regardless of the circumstances at the bar, we have invited him to be around us and continue having him around, almost always ending with a quiet group listening to John because we can’t get a single word in. He’s just annoying.\n\nComplications, my friends have decided that we should go because it will be supportive and we’ll get to see him fail miserably in Vegas. Regardless of how I feel about his decisions, he used to be a good dude that I could actually have a conversation with. Now it is just like Russian roulette, this guy has to project his emotions loudly at anyone who will listen. \n\nI’m feeling like the asshole because I could have just said no without reason. If I had done that I know John would have picked and probed for a reason until he begins making assumptions that are wildly more exaggerated than the true reason I don’t want to be around him. \n\nI’m also feeling like he needed at least one person to tell him the truth. We don’t have emotional mirrors and as a guy I appreciate it when someone can describe reality without being comforting, hard truth sticks like glue and makes most guys reevaluate their position. \n\nTLDR: entitled friend wants luxury outing with the group paying the bills, surrounding his decision to identify as a woman. I may have stepped over the line telling him why I don’t want to go.",

      "description": "A few months ago my partner started studying and part of that study is to work in a relevant workplace. She does this 3 times a week Monday-Wednesday and it's a 5 minute drive from my office. Even though she starts 45 minutes earlier than I do I told her I didn't mind getting to work a little earlier and driving us both to work. \n\nHowever over the past few months I've come to dread our morning commute, she takes over the radio and puts on her Spotify playlists, which are always dreary love songs (Dido for example). She rarely speaks to me - and if she does it's in a very quiet and low tone of voice which I cannot hear over the radio. If I ask her to speak up (as I am a little deaf) and she will repeat what she has said in a more aggressive tone; She will occasionally shout at me that I have been ignoring everything she's been saying (when she knows I am hard of hearing and she needs to be louder), and every time I try to have a conversation with her, she shuts me down; either by grunting and ending the conversation or just groaning and saying she's too tired for the interaction.\n\nToday was our 2nd day back after the Christmas break and after a very long awkward silence I tried to make it clear that I'm aware she's tired on a morning, but we have the exact same sleeping pattern and I'm tired too. That on a morning before I get to work I like to engage a little bit so my brain is at least ready for human interaction, and that after spending a 45 minute drive in awkward silence, its more depressing and leaves me in a worse disposition than if I just commute on my own. \n\nShe was upset with me and said it's not her fault she isn't a morning person and kept repeating that she's just tired. We spent the rest of the drive in silence. \n\nAm I The Asshole here? ",

In the past, we have had our fights and I will admit that the way I reacted at times was not the best, but I am the type of person who gives myself space when I am angry or upset. My boyfriend doesn’t like this, so now I always tell him if something bothers me or if I am upset about something. \n\nA few months ago, I got upset at him because he disappeared for a few days without calling me or letting me know he wouldn’t be home. It ended with me spacing myself from him again. This frustrated him, so he decides to go to one of his friends for advice. I will call his friend Danny. My boyfriend basically just explains to him that I was angry, and he asks Danny how to deal with the situation. Danny straight up tells him to “do better”, and that he should break up with me. The next day I talked to my boyfriend, and he tells me about the conversation that he had with Danny. It hurt me that one of his friends would tell him this, even though I have never met him before. My boyfriend told me that Danny says a lot of stuff, but he always means well. I told my boyfriend that I was uncomfortable with him and Danny being friends at this point, and he thinks that I am being unreasonable. AITA? ",

      "description": "Hi reddit,\n\nInteresting timing - I'm in a similar situation as another redditor on this sub, but because it's still different in a lot of ways I thought I'd explain my situation here.\n\nI've been living with my roommate for about one and a half years and last month we've decided to cancel our contract and move out. In my country, the requirement is to cancel three months before leaving the apartment, so we will still have to pay rent until July. We've decided to stop living together because she'll be done with her studies and I want to move in with my boyfriend. I also don't particularly enjoy living with her anymore as she turned out to be quite selfish in a lot of ways. A lot of things have happened, but one example is her using the living room almost constantly and causing issues with my boyfriend who visits about once a week (her boyfriend is here about three times a week).\n\nNow my boyfriend and I are looking for an apartment, and some of the ones we really like need to be rented out by June already. I'm fine with paying double rent for one month if it means getting the apartment of my dreams, but WIBTA for moving all of my stuff out of mine and my roomies apartment a month early? About 90% of it all belongs to me - she wouldn't have a couch, a table, carpet, bathroom furniture, kitchen supplies, vacuum cleaner, even the desk she has in her room is mine. \nShe wants to go back to her mom's place (who lives 20 minutes from us) in July so it's not like she has nowhere to go, but it still feels kind of like a dick move. \nI don't want to end us living together on a worse note than it already has, but I also definitely don't want to sacrifice getting the apartment I want because of her. What would you do?",

      "title": "WIBTA for telling my friend why he frustrates me?",
      "description": "So, long story short, I've had a friend for about three and a half years who has had a crush on me the entire time. I've turned him down three times, each time getting more and more blatant about it, but he doesn't seem to be stopping his advances, and it's really frustrating that he can't see how awkward it's making me feel.\nAfter the third rejection he sent this long, disgusting, entitled \"nice guy\" message about how I owed him a relationship and had thrown his time and effort back in his face, how I'd single-handedly caused his depression, etc. At the time, despite being furious, I was used to his drama (he'd had several fall-outs with both myself and his closest friends and they were all spectacularly overblown) and kind of said that friends were *supposed* to invest time and effort in eachother, I owed him nothing, and that if he wanted to throw our friendship away over this, I couldn't stop him.\nHe apologised (a bit too much) and for a while he actually treated me platonically. I went to see him recently though to try and rebuild the friendship, and that seemed to reignite everything for him. He bought me loads of stuff despite me telling him not to, he started bringing out the pet names again, made jokes about us having kids, and kept putting me in incredibly awkward situations by asking me to move in with me, saying he could spend the rest of his life with me and waiting for me to say it back, etc. I never returned any of his advances, but didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want to ruin the trip, and I was sort of reliant on him to take me to the bus stop so I could get back home. He'd flipped out before when I'd asked him to stop, had gone hours without anyone being able to find him and the like, so I wasn't going to risk getting stranded half the country away.\nSince then, I've just felt really frustrated with him. He messaged me constantly calling me \"sweetpea\" and \"precious\", telling me how upset he was that the holiday was over, etc. I replied infrequently, and if I took more than an hour to reply he'd send a sad face. I asked him for space several times, but the longest he let me be was a few hours.\n\nI guess now I'm at the point where it doesn't seem worth it. I don't want to be rude, but I don't think he respects that I don't want to be with him, that his advances make me feel uncomfortable, that I don't owe him my life, body, affection etc. I'm tired of being guilt tripped and being treated like I'm the bad guy for only wanting to be friends. I'm tired of waiting for him to blow up again and say I take him for granted and that I ruined his life. I just don't feel like he sees me as another human being with the right to make my own decisions. It's difficult to be friends with someone who I think has a fundamentally flawed view of how other people function, and the rights they should have.\n\nWould I be an asshole for messaging him out of the blue, seemingly unprovoked, and voicing my frustrations? I feel like the only thing that will get the sour taste out of my mouth and let us move on is to tell him how I feel, not just saying \"please stop that\" and sweeping it under the rug. I don't expect him to take it well, but if I sugarcoat it too much I know he won't get the message, (like he doesn't seem to have from the previous three rejections.) I'd like to continue being friends if possible, and I feel like I owe him an explanation rather than just ghosting him.\nIf I *would* be the asshole, then recommendations on how to handle it are encouraged. :) Thank you.",

      "description": "I have never stopped my husband, \"Billy,\" from having fun. I just ask him not to get too drunk because I hate drunk people and I hate that he becomes a totally different person. I think in a good relationship you either don't do certain things if it bothers your spouse, or you do those things in a way that they won't be uncomfortable.\n\nBilly was asked out to watch the rugby with new friends today. “Great! We can have dinner together and watch a movie when you come back”. I said don't drink too much! in sort of a \"save yourself for our evening!\" way. Of course, I know he'll have a few pints but it's a rugby game after all! \n\nI have a chill afternoon. Occasionally I message Billy a funny thing, as I usually do. 6 hours roll by. He doesn't see any of my messages. By 8pm I panic a tiny bit. So I call him real quick to check he's alive. By this point I’m making myself food. He answers, drunk, saying he's walking home and that he's really hungry. Fine. No romantic evening I guess. Whatever, plans change. I make him food. 35 minutes pass and he's still not home from what should have been a 20 minute walk. I call again. \"Yeah we're only 10 minutes away\". Okay, so there's a \"we\" now. I ask who it is because it’s late and I don't want a stranger in the house. It's his friend. I tell him I'll be in the bedroom while his friend is there. \n\nBilly comes in with his friend. He’s FAR drunker than I thought. He gets me out of the bedroom. His friend is embarrassed, and barely drunk. Friend asks to go to the bathroom. I say \"Ha ha hey how come you're not as drunk as Billy?\" \"Because I know my limits.\" Ah.\n\nBilly asks me why I'm angry, acting like he’s chugged horse tranquilisers. His friend thanks me and heads out. I hear glass smash outside. I go out and ask if he's okay. \"Sorry, I forgot I had your husband's glass in my pocket and it fell out\". *Oh but let me tell you what that means.*. When I met Billy for the first time 5 years ago, he had quite a fun little hobby of \"collecting\" beer glasses from bars (\"*they get them for free so they don't care!*\"). I asked him to stop because I didn't get off on low-value theft and he didn’t need to do that. He agreed. Welp, turns out he did it again and tried to get Friend to cover up. \n\nBilly then tries to ask me what's wrong again and I'm like, take the pasta I made you and don't even try to talk to me in the state you’re in. Also I'm sleeping on the couch tonight. He acted like I was the biggest asshole and I ruined his evening, took his pasta to the sofa and fell asleep within 3 minutes. I covered him with a blanket and left to the bedroom. Tomorrow he's going to ask me why I was angry and I will fully explain it to him. Did I overreact or did he go too far?\n\nTLDR; husband came home utterly shit-faced without warning me he was going to stay out all day, missed our evening and I’m the crazy one. And he stole.",

Thay have two lovely daughters together. I was spending time with my newly found nieces (known them since birth, just a different title now) and just being an uncle. Brought around our kids so they could really get to know each other and the like.\n\nAfter my brother's unfortunate death, the ex started posting on FB about how much she missed my brother and making everything about her. Let me remind you, they hated each other, and my brother was in love with the other woman.\n\nShe started three or four GoFundMes for what i have no fucking clue. Got a shit ton of money from all the people he worked with, and I have no idea what she did with it. \n\nOne night I posted something on FB that she didn't like, and she deleted me.\n\nThis gave me the idea to really ream her a new asshole about the whole way she was handling the situation, so I sent her a choicely worded ~1000 words on why I hated her, and what she can do with the money she stole from people.\n\nShe immediately screen shot that and sent it to my mom and sister as if to \"tell on me.\" I am no longer allowed to see my nieces, and have been NC with her since. Wife is still allowed to talk to her and bring our daughters around, but not me.\n\nWhat say you Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway, obviously.  So a few months ago, after years of my partner &amp; I struggling with alcoholism, I banned all alcohol from my home.  I wanted to quit drinking because it was literally about to kill me.  My partner wasn't quite ready though.  He agreed drink outside of the home, but no alcohol in the house at all.  He can keep a 6 pack in the garage &amp; it has to stay out there.\n\nI'm not the type to bring the ban hammer out.  But over the past 2 years, every time we've argued it's because one or the other is drunk.  Things came to a head a few months ago after the last argument.  He drunkenly harmed himself with a razor after a bottle of tequila AND eating the worm.  I had already quit drinking a few weeks prior to this. The next day, his friend came over &amp; they proceeded to drink a case of beer.  About halfway through, both of them were slurring, getting loud, &amp; frankly being obnoxious towards me because I was avoiding them &amp; cleaning instead of socializing with them.  I was mainly cleaning to keep myself from arguing with company. \n\nThe next day, I banned all alcohol.  I told him I couldn't handle the stress anymore from the drunken arguments &amp; drama.  He didn't argue with me, but a couple of weeks ago he asked to \"have a couple of beers in the house because it's cold in the garage &amp; none of my friends are home\".  I refused because I gave in last year after trying to ban alcohol, &amp; he was back to downing 12 packs nightly within a week. \n\nHe didn't argue with me, but kinda pouted &amp; went to watch TV.  But I've noticed that his friends don't like me anymore since he told them no drinking at our house.  They don't even say hi to me now, they just look down &amp; away.  It kinda hurt &amp; now I feel like an asshole.  Am I?  I honestly feel like if I allow drinking at home again, we will break up ",

      "description": "In advance, sorry for my english as I'm not a native english speaker.\n\nOk, this happened some time ago but it keeps bugging me if I was an asshole or not.\nI'll start from the beginning.\n\nThis guy was a friend of one of my 2 roomates. \n\nThis guy asked my friend if he could've stayed at our home for the summer season. \nWe talked before accepting him and eventually he came over.  \n \nI went out for holidays in the period going from July to the end of august, with my family. \n\nP.S.² I sleeped in a room with 2 beds: 1 double and 1 single. Mine was the single, my roomate took the double.\n\nI found my sheets tossed in a basket with some other dirty laundry that didn't belong to me. Then I saw my bed occupied with some other sheets (this guy).\n\nWell, I didn't ask for permissions, it was my house, so I removed those sheets and placed mine. (And, after all in a fairness, no one told me that my bed has been occupied without my permission).\n\nI took this guy sheets, folded them as well and putted aside, in a cool and clean spot. (because, I'm not a barbarian). \n\nAfter this, things seem to be fine. \n\nP.S³ I'm a nurse student. At the time I was in a General Medicine Ward Internship, so I had to wake up at 6 AM, every morning. We had two little drawers, that we used to recharge our phones and other things.\n\nWell, this guy snored like a broken tractor and I have a very light sleep. So, I bought earplugs. \n\nThese earplugs helped me a lot with sleeping but I had a hard time hearing my alarm going off. It would take me some time to hear it and turning it off (on my phone).  \n\nOne morning, he decided that my alarm had to be taken out. So he turned it off and I woke up late that morning.\n\nLast straw. I returned home and faced the guy. I asked if he turned off my alarm, and he said yes. I went furious. I don't tolerate people invading my personal space. He replied with \"I found my bed without my sheets and clothes out of my drawer\". \n\nAnyways, I replied to him that that was my bed, my drawer and my house and if the princess wanted to sleep in the morning, he could've as well taken his things and changed house. \n\nHe said \"how so, I'm a guest, you're acting like this is only your place, shut up\" and things along those lines.\n\nMy roomate, his friend, didn't say a thing and this made me EVEN more furious. What the fuc*? \n\nSo I kicked him, with the help of the other roommate that was also bothered by this guy behavior (the roommate that helped me had his own room, and he wasn't the guy's friend).\n\nIn my country, there is a saying: a guest is like a fish. After 2 days, it stinks. \n\nTL:DR: \"princess guest\" was too bothered by my alarm, took possession of my bed without my permission and acted like it was normal, so I kicked him. \n\nThings worsened between me and the guy's friend roomate so eventually I moved to another house one month after, even if the guy wasn't there anymore.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?

After we broke up we agreed to be friends and all was good for about a week. Then I find out that hes trying to get with my best friend. Now that's not what upset me here, he can do whatever he wants, i don't care. I just wanted to make sure he wasn't going to rush anything with her as she had just gotten out of a relationship. While I was talking to him about this I found out some... interesting facts I didn't know. One of these things was that the entire time we were dating he would always be messaging her and wanting to be in calls alone with her. I asked him about that because I thought it was strange that he was always trying to spend more time with her when we were dating. His answer to that is what made me snap. He told me he did have feelings for me but he always liked her more. He said that the only reason he dated me is because he couldn't have her and the reason why he was moving so fast in our relationship was to make me angry and get me to leave him. This pissed me off so much because I had told him about how in all my past relationships guys would only use me to get closer to my friend (not this one, a different one) and he had assured me that he would never do that to me. I ended up messaging him and telling him how I never wanted him to ever come near me again and that I hated him. I told my friend what had happened and she got pissed off at him. She told me that she did like him but now would never act on that because of what he did. They're still friends and seeing him on the server (this all happened on discord) makes me unreasonably angry. I started being rude to him anytime he would attempt to talk to me and try to be friends with me (I would never try and go out of my way to be rude tho). His friend has even messaged me telling me that if I continue being mean to him I'm \"not gonna like what happens next.\" My friend is also really sad that him and I don't get along and it makes me feel pretty shitty that I'm making her this upset. I couldn't care less about how that guy feels about all this, but should I start being nicer to him to make my friend happy? AITA for upsetting my friend because I don't want to be friendly with this guy? ",

We were in a kind of square or public park and had paused for the view for a moment.\n\nMy wife pointed out a small spot (maybe 2 ball point pen tips) on the white portion of my t shirt and asked \"is that bbq sauce?\"  We had something with bbq, and upon closer inspection I confirmed for her yes, it was bbq sauce.  \n\nI then took that portion of my t shirt and raised it to my mouth.  I'll explain to you what I was trying to do, because I insist that it makes sense but my wife refuses to listen: the spot of sauce was sitting on top of the fabric of my t shirt in a little ball.  Most of the sauce was not in contact with fabric.  I was getting set to have my front teeth clamped around the shirt on either side of the  all and then inhale hard first and then suck on that piece of the shirt.  This can sometimes separate the ball of sauce without really smudging the shirt.\n\nInstead, what happened was my wife pulled the shirt back out of my mouth, smearing the ball of sauce.  She simultaneously scolded me something along the lines of \"dont do that that's gross\"\n\nShe insisted I was embarrassing for having put my shirt in my mouth in public, and that it was gross because I had no idea what it was, it could have been any random shit off the street.  I had the little spot 2in from my face, and she did not- I told her i knew it was bbq sauce, and it turned out I was right so I dont get that point.\n\nI also expressed to her that not only did I feel I was not embarrassing, I felt she had embaressed me by pulling my shirt out of my hand and mouth, and scolding me in public.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I started a new job about 9 months ago and had my evaluation today for my work performance. I am an administrative assistant at a college setting. Most of my work involves data entry,  answering the phones, setting up appointments for my boss, and planning for college events. I received a lot of praise on the work that I do for my department, but my supervisor said that I need to work on my attitude. When I asked for more clarification, she said that I usually have a blank expression while I'm working, and that I only interact with people when it is work related. She said that people in the office have complained that I am not engaging in conversations or discussion on personal subjects (hobbies, family, interests, etc.) and that all I do is work at my desk. I explained that I do interact with others when it is work related (sharing and collaborating on project planning and event ideas, sharing ideas on how to improve work flow, etc). She told me that it was more that people feel like I don't like them because I don't go for after work drinks, or that I don't walk around the office and chat with them on what is going on in their lives outside of work. My supervisor knows that I work a second job and that my free-time is limited outside of work. I also have depressions and anxiety, two things that I have medication for and that have a few side effects that she may have noticed while I'm at work. I don't think I should go into detail about my medical history with my boss, and I don't think I should need to smile at work to do my job. She has tried to pry into my mental state and ask if I was on any medications, and backed off when I told her that was too personal. I'm worried because all the comments on my evaluation were both praising the work I do, but also stating that I need to improve on my team building skills. \n\nSide note: A few months back when my boss was talking to me about why she hired me, she said that it was because I had a nice smile and that she felt like I was an approachable person.

      "description": "For context: i spend the last two NYEves with my boyfriend and his/our friends. My best Friend told us in the summer that she wanted to spend this NYE with us. Her words: „It doesn‘t matter where and with who, al long as we celebrate together.“ \n\nFast forward end of November my boyfriend tells me that his friends invited us to spend new Year together again. My boyfriend tells them that my bf wanted to spend it with us so our friend says she can come too and is more than welcome. \n\nI reach out to her and ask her if it would be okay for her. We would be like ten persons and she knew three of them. She says she dont know because she dont know any of them. I tell her i was always at her partys no matter how many people i know or not. I was there to spend time with her, but i also told her if she doesn‘t want, we can tell them no and we will spend the eve toghether without my boyfriends friends. \n\nI don‘t get an anwer for weeks. On Christmas i text her and wish her and her family a merry christmas. I just get a: you too. \nLast week his friends told us they were going shopping for nye and if we wanted to party with them, we should join in so we can split costs. As my friend dont gave a answer for three weeks my boyfriend accepted and we stayed the night by his friends. \n\nEven if i didnt do anything wrong in my eyes i think she is mad at me. I invited her the last two times to spend time with me and my friends and she twice told me she has to work but i think it was an excuse both times because our friends have kids. I didnt get a happy new year message from her even when she was online. Was i the asshole? \n\nFor clarification: she‘s not a shy person and she was often by her sisters house even when there were a bunch of people she didnt know. Shes generally a difficult person and i‘m reacing to the point where im getting tired of being the one to reach out for her. Shes my bride of honour by the way :( ",

      "description": "I’ve been a semi professional photographer for about a decade now (it’s not my main job but I do commercial work here and there). \n\nMy friend wanted me to do a photoshoot of him and two of his friends. They asked me if I wanted to and I said yes. Then I asked my friend whether they talked about the price or not. He looked at me as if he had seen a ghost. He most probably didn’t even think about the possibility that I would ask for money. Now, if it was only him, I would do it for free, but now that there’s three of them (two of which I don’t really know closely), I definitely want to be paid for that as it’s a lot of work for me to shoot them and then to spend countless hours in post prod.\n\nThe thing is that most people don’t really know what it means to photograph people. They usually say things like “you don’t even need to edit the photos, just send me everything and you’ll have less work”. Can’t do. My photos are what potentially attracts future customers and I can’t release half-assed work.\n\nTherefore, there’s now frustration on both sides of this as my friend thinks I am greedy.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So obviously, my husband poops. When he goes to the bathroom, he takes his phone in with him and watches YouTube. I guess he uses this as private time and a moment to himself. 50% of the time, this is not a problem and is fine. \n\nThe other 50% of the time is when this habit reaches ridiculous heights. He can be in the bathroom anywhere to 20 to 40 minutes. His record is an hour, and I had no idea how his legs aren't just completely asleep. If he offers to help me with dinner after he uses the restroom, I know I will be making dinner alone. If we need to leave to get somewhere and he needs to use the restroom first, I know we're going to be late. It's especially frustrating when we're having an at-home date night and we need to pause a movie, and I hear him in the bathroom laughing. Mostly it is video game stuff, so not anything I am interested in watching. (For the record, he is not constipated nor does he have trouble going. If he can't find his phone he takes 5 minutes tops.)\n\nI'm seriously thinking about asking him that if we're together, doing something, or going somewhere to please not take his phone in there with him. Part of me feels controlling, the other part feels that I am super tired of waiting on him. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Cutting Off This Friendship",
      "description": "Holy shit I can't believe this is a thing that exists. I'm psyched because I've wondered this exact thing about a situation I recently created a few months ago, but have nobody inbiased to really talk about it.\n\nSo I'm going to give a lot of context, even things that aren't directly related to the termination of this friendship but help paint a picture of what the dynamic was.\n\nOk so I had reconnected with a really close high school friend via text messages/snapchat. Eventually we found out we actually live close to each other so we decide to meet up and hang out. \n\nWe go out and have some fun, and end up sleeping with each other. We decide to be FWB for awhile and it's great. One day, however, we hang out (after not seeing each other for about a month, leaving me quite horny) and she says she doesn't want to. I get kind of upset, so I just leave brewing. I think it's VERY important to establish that at no point, neither here nor later in the story, do I even approach her without her consent. I don't touch her, I don't back her into a corner, I literally draw an imaginary line in the ground between us and very intentionally do not let any part of may body cross it.\n\nMy leaving did not sit well with her, she was incredibly hurt (she told me later she cried... so that made me feel pretty shitty) and she doesn't see me for about another month. She still texts me though, and she decides to go visit her family. She ends up asking me to pick her up from the airport, which I do, and we actually have a pretty great time. At the end of the night I make a move and we have a kind of argument/discussion. Basically she's not sure if she wants to keep doing this or not because I was such an asshole. The discussion ends with her telling me we'll talk about it on the phone later.\n\nBut we actually don't. She basically dissappears from my life for 6 months now, and I get it. In that particular situation I was without a shadow of a doubt the asshole. I do get texts from her every once in awhile, but not really any conversations. I continue to tell her how sorry I am and how awful I feel, and none of it is a lie I had NEVER felt such intense guilt. It would actually keep me up at night because I never wanted to hurt somebody I care about like that.\n\nBut randomly, after about 6 months she hits me up again, and asks me \"Do you want to be redeemed\". Wtf what a weird text. But obviously I do, at this point I'll be ok with her just accepting my apology and not talking to me again, so I want in on this. \n\nTo summarize, some guy (we will call him Ryan) she does not like fell in love with her and dude is SCARY. He actually seems like he might hurt her, and he found a guy that she likes (We'll call him Will) and wants to get in contact with him to... idk what exactly, but he's not interested in a friendly chat. She wants to give Ryan my number and have me pretend to be Will to keep the \"real\" Will safe. Obviously this puts me in a pretty bad position, but this friendship meant a lot to me so I agree. I should be safe right?\n\nExcept my dumb ass forgot my FB is linked to my phone number and Ryan immediately knows i'm not Will. So he calls me and says \"You're not will, give me Will's number now\". I don't even even HAVE Will's number, but I keep the act up anyways. Idk why but I thought it was funny for him to ask me for Will's number and to respond with \"But I am Will the fuck you mean dawg?\" Lol. \n\nHe starts threatening me, telling me how he's going to leave me a bloody mess, beat my face in, etc. He's also super racist so that's fun (I'm Mexican). This goes on for a couple weeks, but then I find out he's going to contact my friends and I get mad. I basically tell him if he Continues what he's doing I'm going to call the police. This seems to stop him.\n\nAt this point she starts talking to me again. I mention all this because I know that I did some bad shit, but it's my belief that I made up for it. My life was in actual danger, and she even propositioned this to me as a means to rectify everything, so I don't think it should play into the verdict, but maybe I just can't see things from the right perspective.\n\nThe new friendship doesn't involve sex. I've given up on that. First of all she moved away 2 states over, and it just doesn't seem like the kind of thing I should push for anyways. I make it clear that I would like it, though, and we're very flirty, but I never actually push forward with it. And before you say even that was unsolicited, it's not like there's NOTHING happening. She randomly sends me nudes and really suggestive texts. Sk do with that what you will.\n\nAnyways, for the most part we just talk about our lives. And we talk a LOT. She calls me literally every day for nearly 5 months. It doesn't matter if I'm at work or with friends, she calls. At first I'm really happy (I even visit her once), but it starts to grind on me that she calls me every day and only seems to complain about her life. It's not the only thing we talk about (and we talk for literally hours most of the time), but it always comes up.\n\nShe also starts getting angry when I don't pick up. Once I was out with friends all day and she got mad at me because my phone died. \"Well huh you had battery to take snapchats all day!\"\n\nWell yeah... that's why my phone is dead. Not only does she demand my time on the phone, but she started going to school and wanted me to proofread all her papers, which I do. It's clear she's been out of school for awhile because her essays are terrible; lots of spelling and grammar errors mixed with poor structure. Needless to say, a lot of my time is being eaten up by her. Then she starts disappearing again. She won't call or answer me, and at first it freaks me out because I think something happened, but no. She just wants to be alone, and I get it. It just really starts bothering me that she kind of talks to me when she gets something out of it and conveniently decides that my feelings don't matter when she wants to be alone. I feel like this because it seems like she doesn't care at all during these times about how I'm doing. At one point I got kind of depressed about something that had happened to me, and she didn't even respond to me.\n\nThe point is, I feel like I'm being used.\n\nThen one day she goes on another trip with some family, and asks me to come hang out with her when she returns (I live nearby the biggest airport around, so she uses it). I do and tell her \"hey, next month I'm taking a trip and I'll be passing right by your city (visiting her would literally be like a 15 minute detour) , let's have lunch\". She agrees and tells me to give her details. About a week before I head out I hit her up to remind her, since she can be kind of busy, and she responds with basically an \"ok\", but very disconnected. This was during one of those times she wanted to be alone, but it's not often I come by so I thought it might be special. I text her a few more times through the week letting her know the exact time I'll be coming through.\n\nFinally the day comes and I try calling her when I'm around to try to meet up and get no response. I don't want to waste too much time since I'm on a schedule, but I do wait around for a response. I decide just to eat lunch in town and maybe she'll hit me up during and I can at least say hi (Ironically I ended up eating lunch down the street from where she works. This isn't like a creepy stalker thing, it was a total accident and I only recognized the place based on descriptions she had given me. She also doesn't know this so I don't think it played into her behaviour).\n\nShe never contacts me and I'm frustrated but figure she was too busy so I leave. A couple hours later she texts me.\n\n\"I was asleep.\"\n\nWell sorry, but now we're fighting. I told her the EXACT time I was coming through, and she works in the morning, so you made the choice to wake up, go to work, and come back home and sleep despite agreeing to have lunch with me. She tried to tell me I never texted her, which I responded to by vindictively  sending her screens of the texts which SHE RESPONDED TO. She told me she didn't see those, and I'm starting to boil over.\n\n I feel really used, and she's not even apologizing. She seems to think that her sleeping is a good reason for missing me, when the very fact that she chose to sleep is what bothers me. All I want is for her to say I'm sorry at this point. And I'm not vague about it, I ask her to apologize and we don't have to fight anymore, but she very adamantly refuses to. \"I won't apologize for being me\". At this point it's obvious she's not listening so I tell her never to speak to me again. I feel completely manipulated.\n\nFunnily enough I had shipped a birthday present to her a bit before, so when that came she said thank you and I said happy birthday, but besides that I haven't spoken to her. She's reached out a couple times but I do not respond, that friendship was just too toxic.\n\nBut I also wonder... I was an asshole several times to. Was I being inconsiderate? I mean she was probably really tired, and she has a pretty stressful life so maybe I should have understood that.\n\nI'm not sure, and it still bugs me. Am I the asshole?\n\nSorry this was so long jesus...",

      "description": "AITA for breaking up with my gf because of her hose?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dated this girl for almost three years. We split two times after a big fight, but we always end up back together. She lives about 50 miles in a small town. I live in the city. I spend the night at least 5 nights a week. She never went to me unless we were going out in the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe lives in a single-family house on a small plot of land with a net fence on the sides. In the near corner of the street where I park, in the spring and in the summer she has a vegetable garden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently noticed that she started changing her garden hose to a nozzle, turning it back and forth. It doesn't matter, but the nozzle is different when I get to her house after work. Then when I leave in the morning it is returned to the hose again. (If it is unclear, one of them is a flexible green hose, and the other is a long tube that looks like aluminum.) It took me a while to realize that she woke up at night and went to the inner porch to change it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast weekend it was about 2am and she got up. I think she went to the bathroom. Then I noticed that she was wearing a bathrobe and went out. I asked her what she did. She did not answer me, and I think that maybe she did not hear me. I watched her from the window and, absolutely, she opened the nozzle and changed the hose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her about it in the morning and was able to tell her that she was uncomfortable, so I did not press her. When I left the house on Monday morning, I saw the hose and did not see anything unusual in it. No water or drops or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is now it is frozen outside. Nothing grows in the garden or on the pot. I think that it should be turned off from the water, so I don’t know why she even needs to change the nozzles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis annoyed me all day. When she instagramed a picture of dinner, I didn't like it. Then she texted, but I did not answer.  When I left the office, I didn’t want to go to her house, so I went home.  She texted me several times, and finally, I told her that I feel bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday at work I finally sent her a message and asked why she would not tell me what she was doing with her hose. She did not answer before and after work and ignored my question. I told her that I was finished with the game, and I did not want to be with someone who could not honor me enough to answer me.  She seems to be talking, but we have a long conversation. Finally I got stuck and told her that it was all over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not understand why she cannot tell me what is happening.  She will not answer the question, just like that doesn't mean nothing. I hate it, so I told her that everything was finished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was furiously angry.  Today is radio silence.  AITA for breaking up over a hose?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR my gf won't tell me why she changes the nozzle on her hose so I break up with her.",

      "description": "Hey everyone, So me and my girlfriend keep getting into massive stupid fights over her job, she hates it. When I see a problem though I want to solve it, especially when it's making her unhappy so I keep suggesting she get a new job and she was fine with the idea but then when I start looking up ones she's suited for or offer to help her apply it leads to an argument that she needs to do it by herself or that she needs more time to think about what she wants to do. I can't just sit back and watch her be upset though especially since she's just started on anti anxiety meds and I don't want things getting worse for her, so whenever she gets upset about her job I bring up jobs I've seen going or different avenues like apprenticeships she could do and it leads to another fight about how I need to give her more time to think or about how I can't help at the moment and I just need to step back. I keep worrying that maybe I am compounding the problem but I also don't want her to continue to me miserable. I'm afraid that if I just keep giving her time to think she'll remain indecisive but I also don't want to be a pushy asshole. We just had a fight and she told me I need to stop trying to help because i'm not going to be able to anything is she right? AITA for always trying to help?",

      "description": "So it was a Monday night, around 2am and they had been blasting music for around seven hours. For context, I’m a student who lives with four other girls all of whom are close friends. I met them in September when I needed a room urgently. They had one to spare. We get along well but I’m still the outsider of the group due to being fairly reserved. \n\n\nThe night in question, they were throwing a party and had around 10-15 people over. I was in my room the whole night as I had assignments to work on and an early start the next morning. The music started around 7ish but as it was a Monday, I figured it’d go on for a few hours at most. \n\n\nAt midnight, there was no sign of the party quietening down, so I went out and asked one of my roommates to turn the music down and start wrapping things up as we were well into the quiet hours for our accommodation (11pm-9am) and I had to be up early. She turned the music down slightly and said that people will be leaving within the next hour. I said okay but asked her to keep in mind that it was a weeknight and went back to bed. \n\n\nTurning the music down had very little effect as the bass was literally pounding the walls and people were screaming. The front door shares the same wall as my headboard and was constantly shaking from people coming in and out and slamming the door.  This went on until around 2am when I decided to ring our accommodation security to file a noise complaint. They came up, shut the party down and a week or so later, we received a letter for a $100 fine for violating a noise clause in our lease. They agreed to split it between them as I had nothing to do with it and They have no idea I was the one who complained. \n\nHonestly, I don’t feel guilty because they were being inconsiderate but they’re all currently in the kitchen trying to figure out how they’re going to afford the fine (broke students) and one girl is crying. They saying that whoever reported them is an killjoy asshole and noise is to be expected in student accommodation. AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my wife to snoop on home cameras?",
      "description": "A few months ago my wife and I have had a few cameras installed around the interior/back-yard of our house. Most of the time these are for seeing what our dogs are up to, and if they're well-behaved. Occasionally we will 'arm' the cameras when we are out of the house, but that is definitely more of an exclusion than the rule.\n\nAt our home we have one of our main cameras pointed at our living room/television. In the past couple of weeks I have been at home more frequently, due to work and illness. In one instance, in the afternoon, my wife connected to the camera via an app and remarked on my playing of video games. There's some background issues better suited to /r/relationships that regards my video games, but I handle the subject with a cautious hand. Upon receiving the message that I she'd used our home cameras to see what I was up to, I did not explicitely respond to the fact I felt my privacy was affected through this action.\n\nEarlier this week, while I was playing games again, I received a text from my wife that I did not respond to. About ten minutes later my wife opened up the app to see what I was up to, and if I was playing with the dogs or anything else that would preclude me from getting back to her. At the time I was playing a video game which was clearly evident from the main camera, and I received a text message indicating she knew I was playing. Of course there's the trope of time getting away from gamers, but I feel it was still within an acceptable margin.\n\nAdditionally, we entered into a lengthy arguement about my hesitations on using the camera for 'non-security purposes', and explained my trepidation on the precedence of using cameras to 'verify/investigate' each others' actions. Needless to say this did not go over well. I 100% believe that my wife has the right to use these cameras at all times, however my objection is rather the context of her usage, rather than whether or not she did so. \nAs such, I am curious if I am the asshole for being uncomfortable, and making it known, with 'check-up' in-home camera viewing? I understand we are married and that no exclusive privacy should be assumed, but I still feel uncomfortable with these unannounced camera viewings with the context of seeing 'what I'm up to'.\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the end. Also, I'm new to this subreddit, so if I've overstepped any rules or regulations, please let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I was diagnosed with encephalitis caused by chicken pox when I was six years old, which is a condition where my brain swelled and caused me to lose most of my memories up till that point. At the point where my story starts, I did not know this fact and naturally assumed that I was a brain cancer survivor (I don't mean to be condescending to the real survivors out there, cancer is horrible and I do not wish to be condescending with this post)\n\n \n\nSo a couple years ago when I was in middle school, I (11M) got into my first relationship with \"Emily\" (11F). I had confided to her previously when we were friends that I had \"cancer\" before. After a few weeks into this relationship, however, I realized that I had lost what previous feelings I had for Emily (I just wanted to stay friends) and decided to break up with her. This being my first relationship, unfortunately, stupid me thought that she would lose attraction for me once I lied to her that my \"cancer\" had started resurfacing and this would lead to our breakup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was very concerned about me for the next couple of weeks and I had to keep up the act and therefore lied about not being able to meet up with her because I had \"hospital checkups\" and \"didn't feel well\", when in fact, I just wanted to break up with her. All this time, I worked up my courage to tell her the truth that I didn't have feelings left for her. Fast forward a bit and there's a school dance coming up. I finally told her there, and she took it pretty badly. She ignored me for the next few days, and me, a bit relieved that we were finally over, just ignored her as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then people started to gossip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt turns out she told a few of her friends, who told even more people and I couldn't talk to many people in my grade then without avoiding derogatory comments like \"You're such a d\\*\\*\\*head! Man up!\" It got so bad that we couldn't look at each other across the hall without flinching. Up to this day, small talk of this incident still resurfaces and it makes me look really bad because I'm portrayed really badly, to say the least. I have tried to apologize to her (not that it would make me any less of an asshole) with no avail because she avoids contact with me. We can't even look at each other across the hall without flinching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR A few years ago when I was in middle school, I told my girlfriend that I had brain cancer to break up with her, she told a few of her friends what I did. Her friends in turn told my whole grade, and it makes me look pretty bad. AITA for lying to her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to drop a comment. I do feel like an a-hole up to this day.",

      "description": "Throwaway since it is so personal. Apologies for poor grammar, still fuming.\n\nMy dad and I have a very poor relationship. He has this thing about weight and being thin. When he was young, his dad always said that being fit was key and that he was fat etc so my dad took steroids and became a body builder, (he’s a fat ass now though, side effect of his drug abuse). Anyway, my dad has always called me fat. I remember one time, I was eight and in public with my thin as a pin niece and he kept making jokes about my weight, (i was thick set as a kid but never ‘fat’ or even overweight. I had a normal BMI since I was quite tall). He kept calling me chubby, fat and people kept turning round and looking at me and I started crying. So he said ‘I’ll buy you a chocolate bar, that will make you feel better, won’t it fatso?’ \n\nYup. \n\nHe disguised these kinds of comments behind the need to be healthy, emphasising the need to exercise etc but it always had that undercurrent of ‘you are not good enough’. He used to weigh me every day and make comments like, we need to improve this etc etc. \n\nAnyway, when I became a teenager, the thoughts came. I thought I wasn’t good enough and my dad reaffirmed it every single day. I developed bulimia and anorexia for a eight year period. Threw out my meals, kept everything secret. \n\nI told my parents finally after they caught me with my fingers down my throat and a suicide note which surrounded my need to be thin. \n\nYou know what my dad said?\n\n“You never had anorexia. You weren’t skinny enough.”\n\nAnyway, i have become very spiteful and mean as a result. I take every opportunity to knock him down and other people close to me and I hate myself for it.\n\nOne of my main goals is to ruin my parents marriage. My dad says these kinds of comments to my mum too and treats her shittily. She’s not happy, not completely but she loves him. She forgives him, that’s the main difference between us. She has a history of anorexia and domestic violence fuelled by her dad. She says my dad isn’t as bad so I shouldn’t complain. \n\nAnyway, I had an encounter this evening which broke the camels back to speak. I was trying on clothes, dad came in and just snorted and left. Two panic attacks later, I lost it. \n\nI have given her an ultimatum, i move in with my grandparents or she leaves him. I know I’m guilt tripping her and he’s never hit either of us or anything, or cheated on her, etc. The worst thing he does is drink all the time, (he says most of these things when he’s drunk). I just can’t stand him. I don’t feel comfortable in the same house as him. \n\nI know this sounds like an attention seeking post but I just want someone to tell me: is it wrong to intervene in my parents relationship when they are ok because I have a bad relationship with my dad? Am I being selfish? \n\nAITA?\n\n ",

      "description": "Ok, please keep in mind that I am 13, and don't always make the best decisions. Also, I know this might seem really minor, but I kind of want to get it off my chest and see other peoples opinions.\n\nLet's rewind to a few months ago, towards the end of the final semester of my 7th grade year. I sit in the bottom right corner of my 6th period classroom, and the girl that this is about originally sat more or less opposite from me. This teacher almost never moved students around, but by some occurrence, the girl in question got moved right next to me. Here's where it gets a little more complex. The way I see it, two things might have happened then. Possibility #1is that she was crushing on me before, and she moved only with intention of getting physically closer to me. Possibility #2 is that she moved for whatever reason (If I'm correct, it was that she was distracted by the people on the other side of the room) and then developed a interest in me now that she was right there and was noticing me more. I have a feeling it was the former. \n\nNow, as time passes, things start to get REALLY weird. I can't remember all the events that happened but I can name a few of the biggest. One major thing that happened, probably the strangest (or the most obvious sign of them all) was when she half said half mumbled that we were meant to be together, in these words, \" Oh Halyconbolt, we're meant to be together aren't we?\" It sounds like some line from a shitty high school drama manga, right? Some other things that happened: She payed WAY more attention to me, she tried to talk to me and would say hello very loudly at the weekly youth group event (we go to the same synagogue), and she would make distractions or say things to make me look at her or in her general direction. \n\nEventually, I think she picked up on the fact that I didn't really feel the same way about her, and stopped doing all the aforementioned things. Fast forward to this school year. She would often put things or talk about how she \"was fucking depressed\" or \"was going through some shit\" on her Insta story quite often, which scared the fuck out of me because I thought my friend zones had thrown her into some kind of depression or suicidal mood. She never conveyed that she wanted to kill herself, wanted to die, etc, but I was still worried. I'm still not interested in her, but now, she ignores me at school when I try to say hi, and shuts down friendly conversations almost immediately. The only instance that I can think of her not being a bitch in the past few months is at the (now monthly) youth group event, when she seemed friendly and we chatted a little bit. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my boyfriend his friend was flirting with me?",
      "description": "First off, using a throwaway &amp; typing on mobile so sorry about that. Also TLDR at the end. \n\nAlright, so my boyfriend and I have never been in a relationship before so we're both quite new to the romance department. Im just curious about where I land in this situation. \n\nBackground: \n\nMy bf and I have a mutual friend I'll call Sam. I've always been closer to Sam but my Bf has known him longer. I talk to Sam a lot because I genuinely enjoy his friendship and our conversations, but also because I feel a bit bad for him. He always complains about how lonely he is and he has a lot of personal family issues that I relate to so I kind of sympathize.\n\nHowever, our friendship has never gone past anything platonic and I have never given him any indication that im interested or offered to hang out alone with him, etc.\n\nA couple of months ago I had a bit of a disagreement with my Bf and I suffer from anxiety and mild paranoia so I was wholeheartedly convinced he was going to break up with me. I was legit freaking out, sobbing, the works. Tbh very embarrassing looking back but what's done is done. \n\nI messaged a few of my friends to kind of console me and maybe gauge the severity of the situation because I knew I couldn't do it myself. I have a few female AND male friends besides Sam, whom I contacted. I also decided to talk to Sam just because he was friends (albeit not very close, but he's known him a long time) with my Bf and I just wanted an additional opinion. \n\nSam is very nice to me but he kept on telling me to break up with my Bf and saying \"I deserved better\" and that \"maybe I should move on\". I really really really did not want to break up so I took his opinion with a grain of salt but politely thanked him for his input and said \"I'll see.\" Since then, Sam has never mentioned how I should break up with my Bf, but he has been talking to me a LOT more than before, plus he asks me to hang out on our own, which I always politely decline or suggest a group setting. \n\nFast Forward:\n\nA week or two ago I couldn't login to my snapchat so I asked my Bf to login for me and do my streaks (yeah yeah, very immature, pls don't hate me haha). I was not at all concerned about this because I have nothing to hide and he's done my streaks before for me. He does them and all is well. \n\nHowever, once I login to my snapchat later that day, I notice that he's messaged a lot of people on my account, and Sam is one of them. I didn't really care but I thought maybe he said something funny so I checked the messages and he was just chatting with Sam casually. No biggie. (Sam saves all chats so I could see the convo).\n\nThen my Bf texts me. He asks why Sam was flirting with me and why he told me to break up with my Bf. Im honestly super confused because I don't remember Sam ever flirting with me. I check the messages and see the bit where I was freaking out. I then explain the situation and apologize, telling him I never wanted to break up and that I was venting to a friend (I had never messaged Sam that I wanted to break up with Bf or that I was mad at him).\n\nHere's the kicker: my Bf gets PISSED. He tells me that he no longer wants to speak to Sam after the rude things he said and that he feels uncomfortable with me continuing to communicate with Sam, although he of course will not stop me and I can still do so if I want. He then sends Sam a message stating how upset he is, how he never wants to talk to him again, how he doesn't want him talking to me, etc.\n\nSam has not spoken to me since and I feel awful about it. I never wanted to break up with Bf and I never wanted to date Sam, I just wanted to be friends and never recognized what he was saying as flirting, although I did think it wasn't very appropriate for me to hang out with him by myself (which I never did). I was also a little uncomfortable that my Bf was just reading months and months back into my snapchat messages with my friends, but since I don't have anything to hide im not that upset, I just really value my privacy. \n\nSo AITA? Should I have told Bf that Sam told me to break up with him? Should my Bf have told Sam to stop talking to me without my consideration? I am just very confused and upset and have been thinking about it a lot.\n\nTLDR; I was very scared that my Bf would break up with me &amp; a friend told me that I should break up with him first. Bf read my message history &amp; got upset &amp; told friend to never talk to him or me again, ending our friendship. AITA for not telling Bf that friend told me these things?\n",

      "title": "WIBTA for going to management a third time for my neighbor's bass?",
      "description": "I definitely feel like TA because I never went to my neighbor in person the first time. The reason for this was because at the same time I heard that he got a new sound system, I realized (smelled) that he was letting his two dogs use the balcony below me as their only bathroom (he's on the second floor and grass is literally outside of the apartment with dog bag stations) straight on the concrete, and he has never once made eye contact or said hi in passing so I didn't feel comfortable talking to him.\n\nHe \"works\" from home and so is home literally all day every day of the week while I work from home 2-3 days a week. So when I'm home I can hear his music, video games, and movies any time from 8 (start of non-quiet hours) until 9 or 10 (start of quiet time) when I go to bed, off and on. Just constant rumbling of a bass, like I live above a movie theater or like a revving truck.  I complained to management about the dog treatment and the bass so they anonymously asked him to stop. The sounds stopped for a few weeks until they gradually increased and got louder again by the holidays. \n\nI complained once more about the bass (he finally started taking his poor dogs outside) and it stopped for two weeks until last Friday it picked up again. Every evening since Friday there is heavy intermittent thunderous rumbling from video games or movies while my BF and I watch TV and it's so freaking annoying. Yesterday I worked from home and I could hear his bass through the floor from music off and on literally from 8am until 9pm while we watched the State of the Union. It sounded like a thunderstorm in the distance. \n\nAt this point I feel like it's too late to talk in person if he's mad that I've been going to management, but I want to just point out how his bass transfers and suggest we figure out a way to reduce it. I don't know what management is saying but a  general \"noise\" warning is useless for him. Things were just fine before he got a new sound system and my floor is concrete so I know the construction isn't the problem. We also have a clause in our lease stating:\n\n&gt; \"Televisions, stereos or other sound systems should not be heard outside of your unit at any time. Speakers and/or surround sound equipment should be kept away from the walls and the bass kept at such a level as to not disturb your neighbors. Stereos and/or sound systems in vehicles should not be heard from outside of the vehicle.\"\n\nYet management tells me they can only warn him, nothing else. So WIBTA if I just keep asking management to talk to him? They do say they prefer residents to come to them for issues, but they also don't even enforce what I just quoted. I really didn't want to have to move but I may just have to.",

      "description": "I have been with my fiancee for 11 years, we started dating when we were 17, we both became doctors, she is getting a masters degree and I'm a first year resident. \n\nOver the past five years she has been gaining weight, and has gained about 80 pounds. To be fair I have also gained some weight (about 15 pounds over the past 10 years). Her weight has had a huge effect on our sex life, since I do not find her physically attractive, as her BMI hovers around 39 (Almost morbidly obese).\n\nI have been making efforts to lose weight myself, and have tried to get her involved to no avail, so I finally had to tell her I needed her to lose weight for the sake of our relationship and her health. Now she won't be intimate with me. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Let me clear up some things.\n\nI said she needed to change for the sake of our relationship since sex is a big part of relationships, and is a common factor that motivates divorce. I did not mean I would leave her if she did not lose weight.\n\n- Here are some of the things I tried to do to get her to lose weight: I invited her to go to the gym with me, I started eating healthier to try and motivate her, I got us started in calorie counting and counting macros, we checked her endocrinological profile for any medical problems associated with weight gain, etc. It got me nowhere.\n\n\n-I did not give her an ultimatum, I simply express the fact that our sex life is being negatively affected by her weight gain.

      "description": "Im 18 almost 19 now, and ever since i was around 13 my parents would borrow money from me,  it started out in little chunks but when i got my job it started to be a lot. They both live WELL above their means and so the money that i lent them went right to bills. The total of this got to be 4100 around a month ago. This caused problems for me not having ANY extra money to do anything, ill give them credit they left me enough to pay for my school and gas but thats about it. They would sometimes start to pay me back in little chunks too but that stopped. This always caused arguments because i would explain to them how poorly they are using their money and would literally be able to point out all of the stuff they didnt need that they spent way too much on. This always made them mad and there was a lot of yelling involved on both sides. The kicker of this is that the only reason i lent them money is because my dads brother had all of the money from my grandma who died and would always make excuses not to give it to my dad, well my dad eventually went down there and got his share of the money and i was expecting to be paid back and not have to worry about being broke and wearing the same clothes all the time. Well 2 weeks ago i figured out my dad used the money to pay everyone back that he had borrowed from except me. He paid his friends back, he paid my other grandparents back, but not me. So i confronted him about it and he ended up giving me 1500, and never brought up the rest of it.\n\nThe last argument was caused because my mom would wear my shoes outside in the yard for some reason (i am a 6 foot tall guy with huge feet) but she wouldnt put her feet all the way in and she would wear them like sandals, which broke the heel of my shoes. I very angrily asked her why she was doing that and now i needed to buy new shoes, she starts going off about how ive been cold to them (which is true) and how i dont respect them (also true). I love my parents, cant change them, but i absolutely do not respect them. So i told my mom “it is very hard to respect someone who refuses to pay back their own son” and so she asked again if i respected her and i said “no, but that doesnt mean you guys arent my family and that i dont love you guys” well after that she asked what time i worked on friday and that i will have to have my stuff packed and out of the house by that time tomorrow. \n\nSo, am i the asshole?",

But she didn’t want any of that.  So she’s been trying to find options that are 18 plus which are few and far between. But pretty much there’s only shitty house parties and Dave and busters. Neither of which seem like a good time for New Years. \n\n\n     My Gf is stressing out over this about trying to make everyone happy. She suggested I go out with other people and do my own thing but as we’ve been dating a year I obviously want to spend New Years with her.  So I just compromised with her to go to some shitty warehouse party so her friend will be able to go. \n\n  AITA for wanting my girlfriend to just tell her friend she’s hanging out with me so we can go out and go to actual New Years events as 95% of them are 21+?\n\n\n   TLDR; want to go to bars for New Years . gf has to hangout with friend who is underage so I compromise to go to shitty warehouse party",

I made it known I was fine being held to this standard myself, and was very fine working with any other solution that didn't mean others having to do my dishes or vice versa- really anything with some enforcement method.

      "description": "\nI’m getting married soon, this girl is the love of my life. We have known each other for over a decade and have been together for five years. She moved across the country with me for my new job, she is wickedly intelligent, beautiful and does not have a malicious bone in her body. I have no doubt in my mind I want to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\nLeading up to the wedding I have of course been thinking about the future. Kids, where our careers will take us, the works. I came to the realization that we will likely be taking care of her mother BEFORE we even have children. \n\nNow here is some backstory about her mom.. Her mom, lets call her Margaret has not held a job since she was in her 20s. She has been living off of the state since her last divorce. On the surface she is a nice lady, an actual sweetheart but getting to know her more I’ve realized she’s also extremely manipulative. After my SO will have conversations with her about the wedding she is usually pretty frustrated because these conversations all devolve into what her MOM thinks or wants with the wedding. She did survive a battle with cancer a few years back (thankfully) but she manages to bring it up in almost EVERY conversation for what seems like pity points or to swing things in her favor. She asks for money constantly “Hey sweethearts, I need some money because Billy (her 27 year old brother who STILL lives with his mom and won’t get a job because he has anxiety...) needs cigarettes”.\n\nI’ve come to the realization that it’s only a matter of time before a situation will arise that will lead to her asking to move in. This will probably include her brother. We are 27 and 24 respectively and we are just starting our lives. We both have great jobs but we are building up to support our children, not full grown adults who refuse to take care of themselves.\n\nWe obviously can’t NOT help them in dire situations but I feel they are starting to see us as their retirement plans and it is incredibly frustrating. \n\nHow do I even approach this.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking like this? \n\n(Sorry for grammatical issues I typed this up on mobile)",

      "description": "To start off, I'm 17 and I'm aware this is a light subject. I just wanted some feedback.\n\nSo it's recently snowed where I live and it's the most snow we've gotten in 10 years, being 12 inches.\n\nMy friend lives about 2/3 of a mile down the road from me and another guy was there and we were just gonna hang out and maybe screw around in the snow. Later they said another friend of mine would pick us up in his Jeep and we would go to this hill about two miles away and sled down it. There is sort of a hill on the way there on a road that hasn't been plowed, but my friends Jeep has AWD.\n\nSo I go ask my parents if it's cool for me to walk to my friends' house (2/3 mile away) and then take a ride to the hill to sled down.\n\nMy dad gets pissed at me for asking and then complains about how I've started to hang out with my friends too much and that it's too dangerous. \n\nMy mom says that my friend is an inexperienced driver and that I can't go.\n\nI compromise and then say well what if I just walk down to my friend's house, we hang out, and then they can go on ahead in his Jeep and I'll just split off and walk back home. \n\nMy mom gets pissed for being persistent (asking twice?) and tells me that it's too dangerous to *walk*. In 12 inches of snow. I have boots, layers of clothing, thick socks, etc.\n\nI tried to challenge this by saying I can definitely handle walking this distance in snow, but she said my feet will get wet and ,to quote her, \"I'll get hypothermia and freeze\". On a 2/3 mile walk? If this helps my argument at all, the day before I had gone on a run and ran 7 miles in 38°...\n\nWe argue back and forth for a minute or two.\n\nAnyway, I embarrassingly told my friends that my parents won't let me do any of their plans and just went up to my room. Right now I'm doing homework that won't be due for 4-5 days because I have nothing better to do.\n\nMy parents are now mad at me for not coming downstairs to eat dinner or help with the christmas tree.

      "description": "So I have two good friend who are a couple and every few months they host a dinner party where we drink and eat together pot-luck style. \n\nIt makes them really happy and they look forward to it each time and it's important for them. And honestly, I love it too!\n\nBut during the last dinner party, I wasn't able to be myself due to catching a last-minute cold or something. \n\nMy throat was sore to the point that swallowing anything (food included) was painful. My head was pounding like I had an angry man inside trying to escape, and every noise (even the background music and conversation) sent shooting pains to my head. \n\nSo naturally, I'm just wishing for the whole thing to be over. I'm here to support my friends because they expect me to be there, and nothing more. \n\nI don't engage much in dinner conversation with the other guests, don't really say much at all, and look pretty glum the whole time due to my headache. \n\nDon't get me wrong: when someone spoke directly to me, I smiled and put on an act of enjoying myself. But in-between those periods, I looked like a zombie. \n\nI also keep stealthily checking my phone during the party waiting for a reasonable time to make an excuse to leave (which the hosts apparently noticed). \n\nAt the end, my friends confronted me that I was being very rude the whole time for not looking like I was enjoying myself. \n\nI think I was being a pretty good friend because despite feeling like utter shit, I still showed up to support their dinner party. \n\nSo I guess my question is AITA in this situation?\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because I can be ID on my main account\n\nI’ve known this guy since high school. He was pretty cool but after high school we haven’t really spoken with each other since he moved away for college and I stayed around the area. We’re all still in college 18-20 range so while we get fucked up access to alcohol and nicotine is inconvenient. After 2 years of college, he’s misteriously came back to the area and started attending community college around us. At first it was pretty cool because I got to get back with an old friend, but it soon became apparent that he just wasn’t the same person as he was in high school. There were couple red flags that set off for me:\n\nHe would often lie about his drug experiences and the girls he is getting. Upon verifying these with mutual friends, 90% of these were false. However these don’t really interfere with me, and it’s all harmless so i never called him out on it. But at one point he went as far as to tell me that he’d fuck my ex just to spite me out of nowhere. He then says “issa joke bb” and acts like it’s ok to say that.\n\nHe would call me an asshole for doing something, and then proceeds to do the same. Our friend group goes to a lot of concerts. We all have difference in opinions and who we want to see so I respect that. Now there were two specific concerts happening for nye. They were both 400+ miles away so it was something we have to plan in advance. Concert A was slightly more expensive, had a smaller line up, but all of them were known names. Concert B was slightly cheaper but with slightly lesser names, but had a lot more artists attending. While Concert B would be the obvious choice, at this point half of us already bought a ticket to Concert A and I really wanted to see a specific artist that plays at Concert A. Enter the guy, he didn’t buy a ticket because he didn’t think the show would sell out, so he wanted to go to Concert A instead. A lot of the group were ok with the idea so I tell them I’ll go alone to Concert B if I have to because I really want to see this specific artist. The guy then proceeds to call me an asshole for an hour for not wanting to go with the group. All good, I get it, whatever. What sets me off is that eventually due to logistical reasons, the majority of the group settles on Concert B. He then tells us that he wants to go to Concert A alone. He says he would do the very thing he called me out on a month ago. \n\nLike I said, we like to go to concerts and we very obviously get fucked up. So after an event I once shared my personal experience under the influence. It was very different from my other experiences. However the guy tells me I’m wrong because he knows more than me on the topic as he is a biochem major (note that he no longer attends to that school he was a biochem major at) he invalidates my personal experience because of a book from the 70s said so. So you’d expect him to uphold the same standard for you. However whenever we talk about my major related topics, he tells me that I’m wrong, and knows more than me because he has a lot of friends taking that major. \n\nNow why did I include property on the title? As we were heading to Concert B, no one had alc and I was the only one with alcohol. Since were all under 21, we can’t exactly walk out the door and buy more. As we were pregaming at a different friends house and make plans to leave, the guy comes late with two of his friends he knew from his previous college. He grabs my alcohol without asking and hands it to them and they kill a bottle. Couple things set me off here: I don’t know these people and he took what’s mine and acted like he owned it. Hes previously burnt multiple coils for my vape, he slams my car doors, he hands around my vape to others without asking, etc...\n\nNow in most of these occasions I have not called him out on his shit. I’ve only actively argued with him for the third reason (fourth paragraph). My friends tell me to stop fighting him, but I don’t see how it’s fighting when I’m just feeling actively harassed by the guy. The other day we were arguing about something that does not pertain to him so I get fed up and tell him “shut the fuck up it’s not your business” just so I can change the topic and get it over with. He then resorts to telling me he’d literally beat me up, in person not over the internet.\n",

Jake is on his DS when he asks, “Auntie Sherry, who was the first person alive on Earth?”, and to this Sherry says “Adam was the first person ever created.”. I get a little annoyed at this, and I say to Jake “That’s what auntie Sherry believes.”.\nAnd Jake, ignoring me, asks “Who made Adam?”, so Sherry says to him that God created Adam. I’m getting pretty angry at this point, so I whisper in Sherry’s ear that she knows how Jake is, and that she shouldn’t push things onto him. She says that he’s allowed to have his own opinion. So I say, pretty angrily, to Jake, that “that’s rubbish Jake, don’t listen to her.” \nYes, I know that was a crappy thing to say. It was really dumb, but she knows what he’s like! She knows that he will believe it, and he won’t form his own opinion!\nAnd she starts saying something about how ‘he can listen to her, he can believe what he wants to, he can do this and that,’ and I just storm off.

      "description": "TL;DR - had worst coworker in the world, learned she read our restaurant reviews and was self-conscious so I wrote a fake review insulting her customer service. She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking a girl who hates me from my Discord server?",
      "description": "Hi, this is something that has really been bothering me for the past week and I want to know what other people think. I'm embarrassed and insecure about this, so I made the account just for this to not have it associated with my main account so certain people don't see it. This is a long post, and I'm sorry for that, I just want to explain everything as best I can, and be judged fully.\n\nBefore I go into the story, context; I'm a 15 year old guy, and until the beginning of January, I was in a friendgroup online. Some of the people knew each other Irl, but most didn't. I hung out with them on Discord since at least the start of November, I've left their group chats and servers so I can't check if it was any earlier, but I think it was earlier but I wan't too involved before November. I've made one good friend out of the group who I still talk to, and one who is nice but mostly busy so I'm not as close. In the friendgroup, there is this one girl, whom I'll call Cat. She is 13, and she has always really hated me. I still don't know exactly why, but her main reason are that I'm a \"WHINY FUCKING BITCH\" (quote from the thing that made me leave the friendgroup). I have and still have had not good mental health to say the least, but I'm not going to go that far into detail into it, other than everyone in the friendgroup knows it. Hanging out with that group made my mental health worse, and the main part of that was the girl. She started arguments in the group almost every single day, almost always with one of her friends who she knew for about three years before I met any of them, and the arguments were some of the worst I've seen, but they always pretend like it hasn't happened after a few hours, and go back to acting like good friends. These arguments were always about the most petty of things, and she has freaked out at me for the things like not saying I'll leave the conversation they're having because they were talking about sex and that makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and she got pissed at me for muting the groupchat because she was sending photos of the sky, and , I know this may sound stupid to some, seeing the sky makes me anxious and I have had panic attacks over seeing pictures of it before, and has said and done alot of other things that've made me feel like absolute crap, something that everyone in the friendgroup also knows. I also own and run a server for and about art, which has over 100 members, and although I don't make art myself because I'm crap at it, my friends wanted the server and thought I was the best person to own and run it due to having experience with running and making servers. The final piece of context was that one of the friends from the group (who I will call Rabbit) runs another, smaller art server which has only her from that friendgroup in, and has alot of my other close online friends in where we say alot of personal things. Rabbit and I aren't close, but she was the first person in the friendgroup I met and she's okay most of the time, but has a track record of doing and saying horrible stuff out of pettiness, and lying and doing manipulative things. The main reason I'm still in the server is that most my friends in there haven't seen that side of her, and I want to hang out with them, though luckily Rabbit is only occasionally active. I left the friendgroup because of Cat, due to an argument she started against me in a new hangout server for that friendgroup whilst spewing insults at me. I tried to resolve the argument and told her I'd stop doing the things she didn't like about me, but she kept insulting me, admitted to ignoring and not reading the messages I sent. She then went on to say some things that hit me very personally, so I left the server and every server that had her in, and removed her from my own servers. She has never apologised. I know Cat has had some rough times and has been bullied, and has trouble walking due to the muscles in her legs growing incorrectly, and since has had an operation to fix it, but i don't think this is an excuse to do what she has done or be an asshole.  \n\n\nSo, the story. I'm going to try and make it as unbiased as possible because I want to accurately know if I really am in the wrong here. Me and my friends (the ones not in the friendgroup) were talking about some personal things, mostly how to deal with bullying at school, when Rabbit invited Cat to the server. It took me a second to realise like it was her, due to changing her discord username and profile picture since I last interacted with her, but the numbers of the tag seemed familiar, and I checked DMs and it was her. I then said I was going to go quiet on the server for a bit and to tell me when I can return, as Cat started talking on the server. My other friends were confused since they didn't know Cat, so I explained it to them in a private hangout server one of them made. Meanwhile, Cat had stopped talking on the Rabbit's server and my friends started talking about music, though I only checked to look at it and never said anything myself. Then I get a notification from my server.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCat had joined my server, and because of her hating me and the prior incidents, and I didn't want her to start any arguments in my server, I kicked her. She then tries to join again, says \"Rude\" in the server, and I kick her again and ban her. She then @s me in Rabbit's server, disrupts my friends' conversation, and starts saying I should let her join because Rabbit invited her and she just wants to have fun with Rabbit, and that I'm immature, unprofessional and shouldn't even run a server if I'm going to hold a grudge against her. However, I feel its reasonable to hold it against her considering she is not sorry, has not apologised, and also Rabbit has not used my server in two months. I tell her that I don't want to talk to her nor be in contact with her, and I don't want her in my server, and remind her that the last thing she said to me was \"I NEVER WANT TO FUCKING TALK TO YOUR BITCHASS EVER AGAIN\". I stop talking for a few minutes, so she spams messages until I respond. The argument also makes one of my friends uncomfortable and very anxious, so she logs out of Discord, and no one else talks. I respond as calmly as I can because I really don't want to have another argument, and she continues typing in all caps and insulting me, saying that I have no right to stop her having fun. Then Rabbit joins in and sides with her, and they both keep on arguing that its immature, stupid  et cetera and that I should let her join, while at this point I stopped responding. They then invite another friend from the old friendgroup to side with them in arguing against me. Eventually I respond, and say I'll let Cat join if she apologises for what she said last time we talked, and if she apologises for disrupting my friend's conversation and causing a scene in the server. She then keeps insisting that she has nothing to apologise for and says I should be the one who apologises, and the three of them resume berating me. I change my offer to only apologises for causing a scene in the server, and the same thing happens. I relent because I really just want it to stop at his point, and let her join. She then says some stuff in my server about something she drew, and has not used it since the day she joined, and I go to my bed crying because of some of what she said then and before, and I was worried that i was in the wrong. She hasn't used my server since the day she joined, and I'd like to kick or ban her from it but I won't unless she actually does something wrong because I don't want another argument. I told some of my friends and they thought I was in the right, but I'm worried they only said it to comfort me or the answer was too bias to be reliable. A week later, and I'm posting this here. Am I the asshole?  \n\n\nTLDR: I kicked a girl from my server because of things she previously has said and done things that have made me feel really crap and the fact she hates me, who then threw a hissyfit at me in another server because of it, and let her join after to stop the argument. Am I the asshole?  \n\n\nSidenote: The nicknames of the people in the friendgroup are due to what pets they have. Cat has five cats, and Rabbit has two rabbits. They are good bois and gurls regardless of what i think of their owners.  \n\n\nThanks for reading, sorry that it's so long.",

      "description": "I am really grossed out by nose rings, and they make me pretty uncomfortable. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for about two years now (we're in our mid-20s), and we live together. We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?",

      "description": "Long, long background that I'll shove into a few sentences. I'm 18F and always sick. I currently see eight doctors. I get very weak at my job and have to leave early constantly. I asked my manager for shorter shifts (like 6 hours) and she responded by scheduling me 8 1/2 to 10 hour shifts on the busiest days while still keeping me from getting overtime. She also schedules me to close because she knows I won't leave early no matter how bad I feel because I hate making other people do my  job. Luckily, I've put in my two weeks notice, so I only have to make it until the 31st, but it's still hard.\n\nToday I woke up vomiting. I'm currently going through withdrawal because my doctor cut my anxiety/depression meds cold turkey. I also have an extreme case of sciatica. That's along with my usual health problems. And I'm scheduled to close today alone (Sunday is our busiest day. Packed-out-the-door busy. And I'm supposed to close alone).\n\nI immediately knew I wouldn't make it to the end of my shift and started calling around for anyone to come take over. I got two people willing to come help me until I reached my limit, and then I could go home and they'd manage on their own. I told my manager that I'm sick and can't stay but I got a replacement, and was told that they needed me to stay. Because I'm such a necessary part of the Crew that my health should come last.\n\nSo instead of leaving at 11, I made it to 4:30. That's when I hit my absolute limit. If I stayed any longer, I would've collapsed. No escaping it. So I said thanks to my coworkers and clocked out. Then I got yelled at and written up for clocking out without permission. But? I already gave my two weeks notice so getting written up does absolutely nothing to me. And now I'm in bed feeling insanely guilty for taking care of myself.\n\nShould I have put my work first? Am I the asshole for leaving early?\n\nTldr; very very sick, left work early, yelled at and written up for abandoning the team. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a 23 year old university student and I've been working a relatively well paid part time programming job for the past two years. I try to be financially responsible, so as a result I've managed to save up about 8000 €, which is a decent amount of money where I'm located (eastern Europe).  \n\n\nI'm an only child and I have pretty good relations with my parents, I visit them often during the weekends (the city where I study is several hours of travel away).  My parents have been doing so-so for the past few years - they don't have any debts, but they don't ever manage to save up much money either, mostly because they choose to live a fairly comfortable lifestyle. Recently my mom got a raise so things are looking somewhat better for them. They live in a smaller village and my mom uses her car to commute to a nearby town (the distance is about 15 km), as well as for shopping and the occasional trip to a more distant place(a few times a year at most). Since her old car is on the verge of failing, she wants to buy a new one, which I agree with. However, I think she wants to buy an unnecessarily expensive car for the small amount of driving that she actually does, and she wants me to loan her the money instead of getting a legitimate loan.  \n\n\nI don't think that she wouldn't actually pay the money back to me, but knowing that my parents don't manage to save much, I feel like I might be giving away a large amount of the money I've saved (pretty much all of it, actually) and realistically I'd probably not get it back anytime soon. I'd be willing to give her a smaller amount of money if she settled for a less expensive car, but she doesn't seem much in favour of that idea. My dad seems somewhat in agreement with me on the issue, but he doesn't want to say it to my mom.  \n\n\nI've recently been thinking about renting a flat in the city where I study and work. I still live at the university dormitory, where the rent is fairly cheap - about 120 € a month, which my parents still pay for. I told them that they don't have to do it anymore since I make enough money to pay for that easily, but they are pretty stubborn about it. This is also part of the reason why I feel guilty about not wanting to give the money to my mom. Renting an actual flat in the city would be an insane increase to my monthly costs - the rent for a small place would be close to about 500€ a month, so I would rather have enough money at my disposal in case something unexpected happens.  \n\n\nSo, am I being a greedy asshole here?

      "description": "My girlfriend was recently divorced when we started dating.  She has assured me that while they do have kids together and she does still love him on that level, she is totally over him. It has become clear that this is not the case, and I wouldn’t expect her to be so soon. I know that she loves and wants to be with me, but I’m beginning to think a break in our relationship could be helpful. She talks to him on the phone almost everyday, and only when I’m not around, usually while I’m at work. If I ask about him at all, I’m usually shutdown with “it’s none of my business”, so I’ve learned to not bring him up at all anymore, which is difficult considering I am now taking on a parental role with the kids since he is never around (out of state).  She does little things that are completely obvious like put her phone down the second I walk in the room, then start texting like mad when I leave the room, etc...  and putting his number on silent so it doesn’t make a noise when he texts. I don’t think she is cheating or anything like that, but clearly there is a pretty big emotional aspect to their relationship still, and It makes me uncomfortable. I’m trying to give her all the space she needs to grieve and deal with the divorce, but I can’t help but feel like the only way I can do that is to put our relationship on hold. ",

It didn't take me long to fall asleep even though my roommate was playing on his console. Anyways, he constantly keeps waking me up: turning lights on and off, yelling at people in chat, and slamming shit when he gets pissed he dies. I'm sleeping intermittently, and he finally decides it time to go to sleep somewhere around 12-12:30 A.M. he's super loud and wakes me up as he's getting ready for bed/doing random shit (if I purposefully kept him up bc of this tho...major YTA. because usually I'm not in the room at this time and normally awake if i am).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm awake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly just lay in my bed trying to go back to sleep as he passes out, and can't. so i get bored around 1:30 and start fucking around on reddit, and eventually see a post that reminds me of the dc aquaman movie that i still hadn't seen at about 3 A.M.  So i decide to watch aquaman, and look over at my desk to get my earbuds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut my earbuds aren't there.........\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must have left them in my car. My roommate is dead asleep by this point, and he usually doesn't wake up super easy. so i figure playing it out loud is fine as long as it's quiet enough that it doesn't wake him up. I don't see him move at all, and didn't figure he woke up. So 5 A.M. rolls around and his alarm goes off. He gets up, gets ready for PT, and makes a rude comment about me watching a movie since 3. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe comment didn't really bother me because iv'e told him plenty of times to tell me if I'm doing anything that's getting on his nerves/keeping him from doing shit he needs to do. mostly I'm just confused as to why he didn't tell me to shut the hell up when I woke him up instead of waiting 3 hours.",

      "description": "So I’ve never been super close with her family, been over to her house a few times, spoken to the brother (at least 10 yrs older) in question... maybe once. \n\nWhen she first brought up the wedding, right off the bat I asked her, “this is your brother, who I really don’t know that well,’s wedding. Should you really be inviting your friends?”\n\nNow I also told her right from the beginning, “hey I’m graduating around the same time as the wedding and due to me and my SO’s relationship (he’s American) I won’t know where I’ll be at that point. So I can’t make any promises to attending but I’ll keep you posted if things change.” \n\nAnd for months she kept talking about the wedding and planning things as if I had immediately said YES... but I kept reminding her that it was not something to get excited about in case it doesn’t happen. I even offered to go shopping with her and plan wedding things even if I wasn’t attending because I knew this was a big deal for her. \n\nBut of course the time has come where she brings me the invitation and I’ve graduated and the final asking of my attendance comes up. \nTo which I decline.... and I told her once again, I just finished school, I’m in the middle of moving out of my parents house and I’m literally leaving for the states the day after the wedding. I don’t have the time or finances to attend a wedding for someone I’ve pretty much never spoken to... obviously in nicer terms but that’s pretty much it. All I got in response was “it’s okay I understand.” \n\nSince I told her I definitely couldn’t make it, she’s barely spoken two words to me. I reminded her that I’d still go shopping with her if she wanted but I never got a response to that either... then a couple days ago I snapped a group of my friends, nothing special, but she responded saying, “oh you’re still in town. So you’re coming to the wedding right?” to which I replied, “No S, I’m not coming to the wedding.” Which also got no response. \n\nThe wedding is tomorrow And I’m at the point where I’m just like, are you serious? This is your brothers wedding. I don’t think you should be inviting your friends anyways. Plus it’s a family thing where you’ll be busy with everyone and I don’t know anyone. With my trip the very next day it’ll be exhausting on top of that, and like I said I still don’t have the finances to go shopping for an outfit or present or pay for my seat you know? \n\nIf this was her wedding I’d completely understand why she’d be pissed, but then again I would never in a million years miss her wedding.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

He insists its an alcoholic thing to lie, I should expect it to a degree, and he doesn't think it's fair to separate the disease from the choice to lie.

      "description": "I have an uncle who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia but he doesn’t listen to family members when they offer advice and he has no filter on what he says a lot of the times. A few months ago around New Years time he had found out that I got a boyfriend. This is my first relationship and most of my family knows it is although if I had one before I wouldn’t tell them because it’s none of their business. He calls to say Happy New Years and then mentions my boyfriend and talks about him and where he’s from. And then in the middle of it he asks “oh so you’re not a virgin anymore” I’m extremely taken aback by this because first off its not any of his business what I do and he doesn’t even know for sure that I hadn’t lost it already. Also why would he be thinking of his 20 year old niece in such manner. I reacted and told him it wasn’t any of his fucking business and he handed the phone over to my aunt who I heard scold him. After that encounter I have never felt so uncomfortable I started crying. Since then I have never wanted any more contact with him and I’ve also had a serious talk with my mother who was the only person I told about my boyfriend to never speak of anything I personally tell her to my family members again because they don’t need to know. For info he has never touched me or been creepy at all with me before hand but he has thrown comments as to say that I’ve gotten “fat” in the past when I know I wasn’t. Anyway WIBTA if I decided to not respond to his calls anymore? If and when I go home (about once a year) I’ll put on a facade whenever I see him but other than politeness I will not  talk about my relationship to him nor do I want my boyfriend to meet him frankly even if it means I don’t see him at all. I just don’t care and don’t want someone like that in my life even if its family.  \n\nThank you in advance and sorry it’s a little all over the place. ",

      "description": " \n\ntl;dr: Boss expects me to do business trips with my new car and won't cover full costs. Providing a car is not part of my contract.\n\nI've been working in a small architecture firm for a few years. When I started there, there was no company car, but the business trips to customers, meetings and construction sites were done either with my own private car or with the boss's car.\n\nIf you use your own car, you can charge the office a fixed rate (0.30€/km) for the kilometres driven. In the beginning I still had a used car, so that this rate was also cost-covering for me, in fact even slightly more than the actual costs (\\~0.25€/km). In order to avoid confusion, every employee has this same fixed rate in his contract.\n\nThe contract does not say, however, that I have to provide a vehicle, but only that if I do so that then I get the above mentioned 30 cents/km.\n\nLately the company has grown and more trips had to be done by employees with their own car and were of course also billed to the office. That annoyed the boss so much that he finally bought a company car. From then on, everyone was forbidden to drive their own car, unless the company car was actually already in use. In the past, most construction sites were in the immediate vicinity, so that I was often too lazy to even write a new account for 3 km of distances again and again.\n\nFor some time, however, some larger projects have been added, which are between 50 - 100 km away. One of these projects now starts with the construction, so that the responsible site manager occupies the car almost daily.\n\nAn additional company car would have to be purchased. Instead, the boss hopes that I will conrinue to use my own car again. I have now a much more expensive car, with which each driven kilometer costs me approx. 0.70€/km (loss of value, maintenance, repair, insurance, tax, gasoline ...). Today I made it clear to the boss that I will not make my own vehicle available for company trips any longer under these conditions. He was visibly offended and thought that such additional costs would be covered by my normal salary, and he got really mad. (The salary is good, but not exceptional. Also, the construction industry is booming and we have a shortage of skilled workers and full employment - I could start with a dozen other offices within a week if I wanted to). I think he's a good businessman and part of his overreaction was certainly an act, but otherwise he's a fair man, so I wonder if I was a little too harsh on him?\n\nExample:\n\n2 weekly trips to construction sites on average 150km round trip = 150 x 2 x 4 weeks x (0.70€-0.30€) = 480€ loss for me.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of an accident, I will not be reimbursed the personal contribution of my insurance and also the costs due to an increase of the insurance premium.\n\nAm I ungrateful and AITA for not doing business trips with my private car any longer?",

I haven’t had any extra money, meaning my whole paychecks gone towards my car, my bills, and Important stuff. \n\n\nFor Christmas my employer gave me a $50 gift card to Ulta. Great! I loved it! I put it next to my tv and decided I wasn’t going to use it until I could get to a store as I didn’t want to pay for shipping. I “lost it” a few days ago meaning it disappeared from my room. Now my sister has a streak of stealing my stuff so I went and I asked her. She denied it and told me that my mom has picked it up and thrown it in the trash when she was cleaning the house the other day. \n\nNow I went to ask my mom and she immediately denied it. She started getting angry and flustered and denied everything immediately. Now I’m not a mean person, but I know that things are “never” her fault. Everything that goes wrong is somehow “never” her fault. All I said was “oh my god mom, why are you like this? It was in my room. I didn’t even touch it from the first time I grabbed it.” My dad started yelling at me to shut up. My mom started threatening to hit me and then she got so worked up she started crying. She’s still currently crying right now. I didn’t even say anything besides that. She’s so emotionally and physically abusive sometimes. Anything that gets her attention from my dad will set her off and it’s only when my dad is home. Anything I do or say sets her off.",

At the same time, I never really know what somebody REALLY could use. On the same note, I'm also not one to ask for gifts from others.\n\nHowever, I've been feeling kind of guilty as of late. If the gift-giving (or lack thereof) is mutual then there's no problem, but I feel extremely bad accepting gifts from somebody who I didn't get anything for, but I'm not about to be rude and deny their gift. At the same time, putting out to everybody not to get gifts for me I feel would also come off as rude.\n\nA bit of background of why I'm so torn. I've always felt like giving gifts to people beyond childhood is a bit pointless, unless it's a more thoughtful/personal gift. Say everybody in a group spends the same amount of money on gifts, and receives an equal value of gifts in return. They're technically not out anything, but each person could instead have spent that money on themselves and gotten something in particular that they want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I argued that I wasn’t even feeling pressure until she scared me into feeling it so my anger was justified. I’ve now apologized to her but I really don’t think I was in the wrong here. Interested to hear your responses.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So me (24F) and my ex(30m) were dating for about 8 months. \n\nAt the beginning things were pretty good. We spend a lot of time together because he was on break from classes and I was on break from teaching. I eventually had to leave the country for a month for visa stuff (we are both living abroad) and he also had to leave for a month as well. However, during these months we kept in pretty constant contact with texting and video-calling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem came though when he took on a job in his home country which caused him to travel from country to country pretty frequently. When he took on this job, I asked him if he'd like to break up because there was a lot on his plate (Master's program and an out-of country job) and I didn't want him to feel like this relationship is an extra obligation, but he promised that he'd find a way to manage.  \n\nSkip a few months later and it seems there's really no way for him to prioritize our relationship. We were really only able to see each other in the evenings and there were multiple occasions where we would make plans and he would either be hours late or have to cancel last minute. I spoke with him about how this was a big problem for me because I felt like there was really no room for me in his life and I wasn't a priority, but he agreed to try harder to include me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the summer came, he left the country again, this time for two months. This would have been fine expect it was during our summer break which is when I have ample time and was hoping to spend some of it with him (I'm a teacher so I'm actually quite busy as well).  The first month went ok,  but by the second month it felt like I was always initiating texts between us, and waiting hours for responses. I eventually became fed up and yelled at him about not feeling like I'm an important part of his life. This argument was really never solved. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummer Break is over, and he comes back to the country. I'm hoping to see him and talk things out, but he tells me that he needs space because he's stressed and is still upset with me and himself for the relationship problems and for yellingn at him. I say ok and we don't contact each other for a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reach out afterward to ask how he is and long he needs space. No response for two days. So I sent a message breaking up and saying I can't deal with the uncertainty of this relationship anymore. He responds and says it wasn't because he didn't want the relationship anymore, but because he needs to focus on himself and get through this rough patch in his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for the way I handled it? I feel like I should have stuck through the space and not broke up through text. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still care about him deeply.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I work in a real estate office, and we recently hired new employees. Among them is a young woman, just out of college. This is her first office gig. She's smart, friendly, happy, eager to learn. While she is not the receptionist, she's customer-facing. \n\nThe issue is her appearance. It's... sloppy. She comes in with dark eye circles, old makeup, very messy buns, chipped nail polish, mismatched socks, and very rumpled, wrinkled clothes. Now. We all have those days from time, especially the sleepless nights. I'm not saying she has to press every item she owns to crisp corners. But going over a button down with an iron so the pocket flap doesn't stick up, the body isn't basically crinkled paper, etc. Basic things.\n\nA week ago, she checked in with me on a project. FYI, we do not have an official HR department, we have a business manager who reluctantly does major HR tasks because someone has to. New hire talked for a while, told me she really enjoyed this job, and asked how I thought she was doing. She made it clear she wanted to succeed. I took this as the opportunity.\n\nI said she was doing a great job, but the way she shows up to the office with a very unkempt appearance could use work. I recommended she wake up a little earlier (knowing she has a car and a 20 minute commute) and spend some time trying to look more put together. I pointed out her chipped polish (and I mean half on-half off), the old makeup, and her wrinkled clothes.\n\nHer entire demeanor changed. I tried to let her know that I understand we *all* have Those Days, but that in our industry, and in many others, how you look matters. She came back with \"Well I guess I should go out and buy an iron then,\" kind of scoffing, and, \"I didn't realize it was the 1950s. I don't even know anyone who owns an iron.\"\n\nI knew that I'd upset her, so I put up my hands and said, \"It was just a suggestion.\"\n\nShe left after thanking me for the advice. BM pulled me aside the next day to share that the new hire had gone to complain to her about feeling singled out by me, and suggested even that I had a personal problem with her. BM wasn't concerned, but when the older long-time employees caught wind, several of them told me I was in the wrong, the girl is new to the workforce, that maybe she never learned these things from her parents, they don't teach this stuff in school, etc. Other disagreed, BM included. \n\nAITA? Should I have just let it go?",

      "description": "I've been seeing this girl for 8 months now. Sadly she suffers terribly from depression and anxiety. Because of these issues we've been unable to make any progress in terms of relationship. She hardly ever wants to get close, the furthest I've ever got is having my arm around her sitting on a bench. This is hard for me, I'm a very affectionate person, I desperately want to be closer but due to this barrier she's put up I'm stuck here. \n\nNow I've always said I'd wait for her, and that I'd put her mental health first. But now it's getting to the point where I need to consider my own mental health, the longer I wait the more lonely I feel. As pathetic as this is gonna sound, and I've done my best to prepare myself for the roasting, at this point after 8 MONTHS, I need a girlfriend. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is with a scene from Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson briefly dies and is taken to where his deceased lover is. There's a barrier between them, he screams something along the lines of \"Vanessa there's something here, I can't get to you!\" I feel like Wade in that scene, it's like I can see a girlfriend there, I can see what's on the other side of the anxiety and depression barrier but no matter how hard I try I just can't break through it, go round it, unlock it, anything.\n\nLast month, I even used the \"L\" word, I told her how I felt about her and the answer was the same as it's always been. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, she's showing no signs whatsoever of opening up. I can't wait for what could potentially be years! \n\nAm I the arsehole for saying, \" I can't wait forever\"",

My mom cannot let silence go unfilled, and doesn’t get hints very well that we’re just not constant-chatter-type people. It’s incessant updates about family or friends, reading news headlines out loud to no one in particular, gossip, asking questions we’ve already answered (i.e. she does a lot more talking than listening), and narration of whatever she’s doing or is about to do. And it’s not like she doesn’t have anyone else to talk to. She has a lot of friends and other family, etc. Occasional silence is not awkward in our family; it’s comfortable. But it’s seemingly impossible for her. I made an effort to try to talk about this with her, trying my best to be respectful and mindful of her feelings, but it just made me ask myself if I’m the asshole here. She is a big help in many ways, including financially - should I just consider the constant, near-mindless chatter part of the deal?",

      "description": "Background: My mom is in fact morbidly obese (BMI +40), she's in her mid sixties and had pneumonia a few weeks ago, which she found very hard to recover from. She has also been dealing with difficulties with her breathing for years and I have been having the suspicion that she has sleep apnea. She has multiple health issues because of her weight and she is pretty much one bad knee or back injury away from being bed bound.\n\nMe and my parents had a nasty fight about some other topic. My dad leaves the room and I continue arguing with her. She tries to guilt me into stopping the argument telling me that she almost died because of her pneumonia (she wasn't hospitalised or anything), I tell her that she hasn't been taking care of her health. I tell her that her weight is out of control and that she is morbidly obese and that her health will continue to decline, she screams at me that I am insulting her. My father comes in again and starts screaming at me to leave her alone and threatens to beat me up and then throws things at me (a regular occurrence since my childhood).\n\nI just went to my room and haven't spoken to her since yesterday.\n\nI'm just pissed at her for letting her health decline like this. I will one day be forced to become her nurse in her old age and her weight is going to make that a lot harder. I don't know how to deal with that. And she just doesn't want to hear it. She thinks she will live to be very old and be in good shape, when I doubt that she will turn 70 without being bed bound. I am afraid for her. I want her to live a healthier life. I don't want her to die early or be in bad health. \n\nI know what it feels like because a few years ago I was even heavier than her. I have since lost the weight and have kept it off by counting calories. I know a lot about the subject and I know what she needs to do to at least lose some of the weight. I have tried offering her help, but she always just listens and agrees and then the next day she is having cakes multiple times a day with my father again.\n\nI'm sorry if this all sounds cold, I'm just tired of the whole situation. I love my mom very much, but I'm scared for her and I have been losing my patience.",

      "description": "I live in Arizona, and I saw a small cat/kitten come right up to me. I had never seen it before, but she was VERY friendly, so I picked him up and took him inside and gave her a little bit of turkey.\n\nI was planning on finding out if she belonged to anyone, but then this conversation happened. Neighbor said hi to me and asked if I saw tabby cat. She's about six months old and she can't hear.\n\n\"Wow, so she's deaf?\"\n\n\"Yes. Can't hear a bit. We found her in a dumpster. We've had her for a few weeks now.\"\n\n\"So she escaped the house?\"\n\n\"Oh no, we let her stay outside. She comes back home when she's hungry. We're afraid maybe a dog got her or something.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear about that. I'll look out for her.\"\n\nNow at this point, I was torn. On the one hand, they rescued this kitten. On the other hand, there is NO WAY a deaf cat can be left outdoors. It has very limited natural defense to other predators, dogs, snakes, cars, and other cats. She would almost certainly die a very premature death.\n\nSo we moved from Arizona to California shortly after that, but I kept the cat and never told them about it since, obviously, I don't want to be arrested for stealing and I want to continue to car for the cat.\n\nShe's strictly an indoor cat, and gets along fine with my other two indoor cats. She's grooming herself at my feet right now.\n\nI know IATAH for stealing the cat and making them feel like the cat got killed or something. That's a horrible feeling. But the way I think about it, there was a very good chance that this cat was going to get killed anyway, and they were going to feel horrible anyway. And I saved a cat. So overall, the net good-bad  is positive, so NTAH.",

      "description": "So this happened about an hour ago and it's been eating away at me. For context I'm a female(17) with a history of anxiety and depression that has been diagnosed by a diagnostic child therapist back when I was 14. I've always had issues with any relationships which is why I'm uncertain if I am the asshole. \n\nThere's a girl in one of my friendship groups who I'm not 100% sure she likes me, she's always very rude; constantly states (with zero irony) stuff like \"you can't be racist to a white person\". Anyway she made a joke about my appearance on her Instagram story, usually I can handle this and the situation would have been better if I actually knew her as more than just a girl who happens to be friends with my friends. I asked her kindly if she would take it down, \"hey normally I would laugh this off, but please can you take this off your story I'm just having a rough night\" she read the message and proceeded to ignore me. With my anxiety I then began to think the worst possible outcome and that I had somehow pissed her off and that she had done it out of spite. \n\nSo I messaged 3 people I knew who were her friends (2 of which are in a GC, I only ended messaging the other one when they hadn't mes saged me back either, which again didn't help) the people from the GC sent the aforementioned girl screenshots of the GC. The other girl was fairly supportive. Once they all messaged her, she sent me a very Curt no and proceeded to say she wouldn't take it down because it was 'bants' and I shouldn't take it seriously because I do look like the image, I shouldn't let it affect my mood, to fuck off because if I wasn't pissing her off before I was definitely pissing her off now, that I'm a shady hoe because I was going to 'banter' back with her and say she looks one of the aliens from Dr who. But decided against it after I found out the people I were talking to were also telling her everything. Not once did I say anything bad about her back apart from that but that was after I was told that it was just banter and I should say something back from one of the girls in the gc.\n\nI've told them all and her specifically that I struggle with body image and with my emotions due to anxiety and depression also that it was bad timing (due to recent low mood due to a discussion I have had with Nhs mental health services about my past and current mood this morning, also the anti depressants making me too tired to emotionally cope. I didn't tell her this ofc I don't know her well enough and I'm afraid she would use this against me due to her previous actions). However she just proceeded to reply with get over it, as did the girls from the GC however they added that she does it all the time and I should just strike back. I don't want to strike back because I hardly know this girl outside of college, I don't know how she'll react and from what I've seen of her in college she's not a nice person.\n\nTl;dr- a girl i don't really know made a joke about me even though her and our mutual friends know I have issues. I was told promptly to get over it, despite respectfully asking her to take it off her ig story",

      "description": "So my friend and I are both college debaters. This summer, we're setting up a debate camp for high schoolers to improve their skills. We agreed not to do this for money, but because we genuinely love debating. Today, we had a disagreement about who we should let in.\n\nHe thinks we should let everyone who wants to in. I think this a bad idea. We've set our fees at a pretty low rate anyways, so if we let anyone in, we'd get *lots* of kids- since there are no other debate camps in the area.\n\nI suggested the opposite: only allow people with a certain levels of wins/points. This would do two things: 1) keep the numbers low-ish, so we wouldn't have a lot of people and ultimately chaos 2) it would ensure we're actually getting talented debaters. \n\nMy partner took offense to this and said he wants the camp to be for everybody. I don't see it that way. Our camp is designed to improve the skills of already good debaters to get to the next level, not teach mediocre debaters. I know with practice a mediocre debater can be a good debater, but I'd rather spend my summer watching a good debater become great rather than a bad or mediocre debater become kinda good. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "My parents recently decided to go on a family trip to Las Vegas for my aunt's birthday party. I didn't really want to go since big cities aren't really my place (and because I'd be the only non-adult), but I didn't want to seem ungrateful and I knew they wouldn't let me stay home alone anyways. Things were going alright for the first day but during the second, I felt so... unwanted. My uncle pretty much straight up said I shouldn't have come along and they treated me like I was dull because I didn't want to get drunk and party (the only times I ever drink is because I want to fit in, not because I like it).\n\n We went to Fremont, the older part of Vegas, and that's when I could hardly keep myself together. There were way too many people around (some weirdo kept following me and making sexual jestures), everything was so noisy, and I felt so alone. I tried my best to keep it together, but I just couldn't. I started getting really bad anxiety and began crying. My mom saw me and told everybody I was crying, which made it worse, and took me back into one of the buildings where she forced me to talk about what was wrong. I didn't want to tell her because I knew she'd say it was a stupid reason to be crying (because she'd done that before), and I was right. We took a taxi back to the hotel and she kept pestering me about it, saying that I was a spoiled brat and that I should just loosen up and have fun.\n\nAt first I was so shocked and angry that she would say that to her own daughter, but now I'm having second thoughts. Maybe I shouldn't have been so dramatic and tried to have fun even though crowds and parties really don't go well for me. I could've even had a few more drinks to lighten up. Was I being selfish or did I do the right thing? I'm not really sure anymore.",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nI (f, 32) have been in a relationship with my husband for 7 years, we've known each other for more than 10 years. My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.",

      "description": "For reasons unbeknownst to either of us, my girlfriend's dog is absolutely terrified of me.  This is the usual routine when we enter her apartment together:\n\n- The dog hears the door open and excitedly runs around the corner to see my girlfriend.  As soon as it lays eyes on me, it turns around as fast as possible (you can hear its nails scratching the carpet) and sprints into the furthest away room to hide in the corner.\n\n- As it runs away, it pisses and shits all over the floor in terror.\n\n- At this point my girlfriend is embarrassed and asks me to stay near the door while she cleans up the piss and shit.\n\n- The dog then stays in the corner of that one room and will not move under any circumstances (unless I come near it, in which case it sprints away as fast as it possibly can).  Despite having dated this girl since last summer, I have never once seen her dog voluntarily come out of that corner, including instances when I stayed over for three or four days at a time.  I'm not exaggerating.  It will stay in that corner, motionless, for days on end.  If she picks it up and walks over to me, then it starts violently thrashing like a fish out of water until she puts it down so it can run away.  If I stand right outside the room it hides in, then it just stares at me and visibly trembles in fear.  My girlfriend has the put the food bowl right in front of it so it can eat without leaving the corner because otherwise it just won't eat, sometimes for days.  And even when the food bowl is right in front of it, my girlfriend says it doesn't eat as much when I'm around as it usually does.\n\n- Whenever I leave, my girlfriend says it's playful, affectionate, and \"a totally different dog.\"\n\nI should also note that there was an incident in December when I pet it and it aggressively bit me multiple times, so bad that people were asking me what happened to my hands.  I now have scars on both of my hands and haven't tried to interact with it since then.\n\nMy girlfriend has dropped some hints that she'd like to move in together, but frankly I don't want to live with that dog.  And I don't think I'm being unreasonable.  Why would I want an animal around when it: A) pisses and shits all over the place whenever I come over, B) refuses to interact with me in any capacity whatsoever, and C) has a history of attacking me.  And frankly, if the dog is this deathly afraid of me, then us living together honestly wouldn't be good for it either.\n\nMy girlfriend sees my perspective and has said that she may be willing to consider giving the dog to her ex-husband (they got the dog when they were together, but she took it when they split up), but I'm curious if I'm being an asshole by expecting her to do this.",

      "title": "AITA for not offering to financially help my mother with a housing issue and reminding her to keep on her caseworker to help her find a place to live?",
      "description": "My mother currently lives in subsidized housing via a program for people with mental health issues. She's on disability and has mobility issues. About a month ago, she messaged me in a panic saying the people who run the program just informed her they're selling the house she lives in and she needs to move out by April. She has a caseworker that's supposed to be helping her find new housing.\n\nCurrently, she's in the hospital. She just had hip replacement surgery and is recovering from it.\n\nHere's where the issue comes in... Yesterday evening, I called her to see how she was doing. We talked a bit, updated each other on our lives, she'd called earlier and I hadn't answered because my fiance and I had just gone to see a movie and were setting up the Oculus rift he got us with part of his tax return (important later). All was well until I asked her if her caseworker had any leads on housing... It's something I worry about, since, you know, she's my mother. She said no, and she hadn't really done any looking herself either, even before her hip surgery.  I just offhandedly said, \"Oh, well, when you're feeling better you might want to get on your caseworker to see what's up.\"\n\nShe freaked out.\n\nShe told me I was treating her like a child, and it evolved from there. She told me I didn't understand her life. I was confused, so I asked what it is that I didn't understand. She started in on how I was telling her about seeing movies and Oculus rifts and she couldn't remember the last time she'd seen a movie. I hadn't meant for her to feel like I was rubbing that in her face; we talk about movies and TV together a lot! Then we went back to the housing thing, and she said, \"I didn't tell you about this so you could try and fix my problems. I just wanted to hear that you were sorry for my situation and you'd be here for me and help me any way you could! And that's one word I haven't heard from you this whole time: help!\"\n\nI stopped her there because I felt myself getting too angry to have a decent conversation with her. I told her I was going to let her go so she could get some rest and so I could cool down. She just kept asking \"really? Really?\" Until we hung up. I texted her later to tell her I loved her and I will help however I can but I needed some time to cool down.\n\nMy AITA question isn't about me ending the conversation to cool down; I'm starting to wonder if I've been a bad daughter. Should I have immediately offered help and financial assistance when she told me about the problem? Am I the asshole for spending money on myself instead of helping her with her issue, even though she didn't ask for it? I feel like she's saying since I'm her daughter I should have offered something immediately and now I feel guilty because I didn't. Should I have not even said anything about getting on the caseworker?\n\nTL;DR: Mother gets angry at me for spending money on myself instead of offering to help her with a housing problem and reminding her to check up with her caseworker about finding a new place to live. AITA for not putting her before my wants even though she never asked for help and mentioning checking on the caseworker?",

      "description": "\n\nHello team \n\nBefore we begin, I know it is easy to go off track on this kind of topic. Please do not turn this into a ‘are trans people/bisexuals/gay people okay and/or are they real’. Also I am very interested in whether or not I’m in the right or if I’m wrong as I don’t know what to think. This is much more relevant than any advice (otherwise I would have asked in an advice sub! ). Thanks! :D\n\n\nI am a 19 year old cis girl dating a 19 year old trans guy. We are both college students and have recently came out to our parents about our identities... and both sets of parents are absolutely heartbroken. \n\nOf course initially it looks like a total case of NTA - of course we should be able to live how we want authentically right? \n\nBut our parents just do not understand. They think we don’t know what we are doing and that we are this way due to some sort of childhood trauma or mental illness (I know gender dysphoria is counted as a mental illness but having a trans identity itself isn’t. ). My BF is having a particularly hard time as many people still don’t quite understand how transgender people feel and live and his parents are finding it VERY hard to deal with. Our mothers will not stop crying, it’s as if they’re mourning. \n\nWe are both so patient (especially my BF who is desperate for them to see how wonderful his life has become and how happy he is now that he can live as himself and is ready to hold their hands through this change) and ready to help, we aren’t the kind of people offended by questions or misunderstandings, even though it is a little upsetting. But they truly won’t accept it at all. My dad is losing sleep, my mom is crying. His parents are acting like he’s going to die. \n\nEven though they don’t understand or support us and our identities are making them upset, we work so well together. My BF is so kind and clever, I’m just so proud of him. Because we refuse to sacrifice our happiness for that of our (much loved) parents...... AWTA? \n—————————-\n\n\nTLDR; we are LGBT and want to stay together, but our parents are devastated and it seems like an asshole move to rub it in their faces (read: existing as ourselves)  when both our moms are literally crying over it",

      "description": "English is not my first language so I apologize in advance.\n\nMy girlfriend has always been into drawing and painting, especially ink work and watercolor. She would love to become a professional, full time artist. She is very committed to this but is also very hard on herself in that she often thinks she isn't good enough. This is (I think) sometimes made worse by me being a hobbyist as she tends to compare herself to me and use it to insult herself.\n\nMy job is unrelated to the arts but I make cards, drawings, and so on of my favorite actors and for my friends, and of course her. I'm generally a more analytical person and good at finding strengths and weaknesses, and this also applies to my own work. I have a good sense of balance, colors and proportion but I can lack in anatomy and consistency. I am far from the best artist in the world but compared to the average person I do pretty well.\n\nBeing more analytical, I can also see the strengths and weaknesses in her work. She does well inking but often struggles with her creativity and coloring. Her ideas tend to be very cliche, for example if she was asked to draw a picture of depression she may draw a girl crying with a broken heart in the background. Part of this is probably just her lack of confidence stopping her from really pushing it. \n\nBut because I am her partner, I am always there to support her in drawing. She is open with me about her insecurities and I always tell her that as long as she believes in herself she can do it. She is also still learning, she is taking art classes so I also tell her as she learns more it'll be way easier because she'll know how to use the materials. \n\nA more blunt friend pointed this out to me and told me that by encouraging a bad artist I'm just disrespecting my girlfriend since she won't be able to succeed in that field. This is not the only field my girlfriend is considering but I would like to hear some opinions.",

I told her she should have told me before telling everyone else because I had a right to know first.\n\nWe got in an argument about it, and I told her I wanted to break up. Why would she randomly come out as bisexual now? Something must have triggered it. She must have hooked up with a girl or something, so I called her a cheating whore (I kinda regret that), and then she started acting all crazy and yelling at me and calling me an asshole and stuff.\n\nAlso, it's basically a fact that bisexual women are really horny all the time, and if I stayed with her, she would have probably ended up cheating on me. If she cheated on me with a girl, that would be embarrassing as fuck. People would take the piss out of me for it. My friends would never let me live it down.\n\nA few days later, I started regretting my decision a little because she's quite hot, so I texted her and told her that I'd be open to getting back together with her as long as she promised to never cheat on me with a woman, and that if she was attracted to a woman that I'd be open to having a threesome with her and that woman so that she could get it out of her system.\n\nShe started getting angry again and acted like a crazy bitch and told me to go fuck myself.\n\nI'm really pissed because I feel like I was being perfectly reasonable, and I even offered her an alternative to breaking up, yet she's acting like I'm the one in the wrong and like I'm a bad person or something.

      "description": "A bit of context for you guys:\nI am a freelancer in the entertainment industry and I'm traveling around Europe with some artists so I see my cousins only a few times a year. They always have the same wish for their birthdays, a trip to a show with me and my mother. So we gifted them tickets to a show including a train ride to the venue and back. The train takes around 2 hours to get there, the show has a length of around 3 hours.\n\nA week before the show my mom got really I'll so she wasn't able to go to work and had to cough really bad. Like really really bad, she could only stop when using a inhaler for around 2 minutes.\n\nIn the morning, 2 hours before the departure she has to cough every 2 minutes so i tell her that it wouldn't make any sense for her to go with us to the show, not only because she wouldn't enjoy it but also the rest of the guests would be annoyed. (We had seats right in the middle between other guests) She then said that its okay and she just wanted to say hello to my cousins before we would take the train. Half an hour before departure she had to cough so hard that she had to throw up. At the train station she then told me that she would come with us.\n\nI said that if she would come with us I wouldn't go because I can't support that. She got really angry but we went without her in the end.\n\nNow I feel bad on the one side for not giving her the option to see the show but on the other side I think that the day would've been ruined for my cousins if she would throw up again.\n\nSo AITA?",

Ive never been fired or made redundant before and it came out of no where. \n\nThis was my first real job in my career and is directly connected to my Visa since I live abroad. Since I live aboard my closest family member is over 3k miles away and I have very few close friends here (my boyfriend was my best friend for the past 2 years before we officially started dating).\n\nHe lost his job back in November (he was fired since he would not show up for work/go out partying every night) and I was there for him all through December and the holidays for when he was upset. During this time he never went to see his family (he was born here so his family is only about 40 mins away). \n\nHe's back working now so all week I've been left to deal with this on my own until he comes home and even then he wouldn't really want to talk about it or would fall asleep.\n\nI was okay with this as I assumed this weekend would we be able to spend time together and talk then. \n\nYesterday he let me know he would be away to go see his brother this weekend and that he'd be staying there. (There is no real reason other than he hasn't see him in a while). \n\nAITA for getting mad at him for leaving me alone after one of the most stressful weeks of my life?

      "title": "AITA For putting my roommate's belongings in a pile?",
      "description": "So my roommate was moving out the other month to get more workspace for school, as well as due to some logistical reasons and some personal conflicts. We shared a lot of stuff communally so when it was time to move out we naturally ended up talking about what stays, what goes and how to go about it. We agreed if anything valuable they originally bought was to stay behind like appliances or furniture that I needed, I could pay for it. Once they got their new place the plan was that they would start making trips of mostly the big stuff and then after a while if there was still some communal things left over that I didn't want, I would start a box and we'd go over it. \n\nThis is where the misunderstanding started.\n\nI waited 3 weeks after they got their new place and they had started taking trips. I helped move and put stuff together, packing and all that. It was all going smoothly, and we were still on good terms. I called them and mentioned casually that there were still a few things left behind, and that I was going to put them in the box like we mentioned. I gave a few examples (this scarf, that jar) and the conversation went well.\n\nI maybe definitely went overboard on the box. It wasn't intentional, but when my roommate came back to pick something up and say hi there were probably 30 or 40 things, and they definitely didn't fit in the box. It also wasn't sorted, it was mostly just a pile on the couch :/\n\nRoomate lost their shit, called me at work crying and said all of this stuff about how I was trying to get rid of them, how I only wanted to keep the 'good stuff'... Apparently their foster parents neglected and mistreated them, and one of the things the family did was throw all their stuff in a pile... I had COMPLETELY forgotten about that, but I did know. This was a really distressing for Roommate and I apologized profusely. They had to go to work right after seeing the pile too, which hella sucks. I probably should have known better and it did go through the back of my head that putting your roommate's things in a pile was something you did to kick them out, but I ignored it because we had talked about it first. \n\nI ended up taking the pile apart, sorting it, putting some things back... I felt really bad and wanted to make it better. We're on good terms again but I still feel terrible.",

      "title": "AITA For Being Upset About Slow and Poor Service on Black Friday?",
      "description": "Thursday night, a few family members and I went Black Friday shopping, as we do every year, and every year we finish our night at the same 24/7 restaurant (similar to Denny's and IHOP). We were prepared for a long wait, since previous years we've had a 30-45 minute wait just to be seated.\n\nThis year, however, they weren't nearly as full as usual, and we got a table for eight right away. Hostess took our drink orders, and the waitress showed up a few minutes later with the drinks and took the food order. So far so good.\n\nFour more groups got seated in our area shortly after we did, so I was starting to expect slight delays. But, we were all talking and having a good time, so no worries. Once the other tables started getting their food, our conversation started turning to how long we'd been waiting, and I pointed out it had been over an hour since we ordered. So my sister went to ask the waitress about it and she said she would check.\n\nA couple minutes later the waitress came to our table and unapologetically said \"There was a miscommunication, your ticket didn't get entered. They're working on it now\". We were all a little taken aback by the annoyed tone and lack of any sort of apology. Also worth noting none of us got a refill on our drinks yet.\n\nOur food arrived about 30 minutes later, all four of the other tables already got their checks and left, two of them replaced with new customers. All by the same waitress, who at this point had been to our table 3 times. Once to take the order, once to explain the delay, and now to drop off the food. She had to work around our table to serve the people in the booths around us, so it's not like she didn't know we were there.\n\nCue round two of the problems. One of us pointed out he didn't get any of his sides. The waitress responded \"That doesn't come with sides\". He said,\n\nHim: \"But the menu said it does\"\nWaitress: \"I think you ordered the discounted version without sides\"\nHim: \"No, I pointed to that.\"\nHer: *sigh* \"fine.\"\n\nAt this point my sister chimed in about her food. Biscuits and gravy.\n\nSis \"Umm, there's no gravy on here\"\nWaitress \"I'm not familiar with that menu item, but I'm pretty sure that's how it's supposed to be\"\nSis \"But, it's biscuits AND GRAVY\"\nWaitress \"okay, I'll check.\"\n\nThen a third person: \"I didn't get the dipping sauces for my food either\"\n\nWaitress: *big sigh* \"got it\" and left as quickly as possible.\n\nStill no hint of an apology for anything.\n\nWhile she was gone, those of us who got our full orders started eating. My other sister cuts into her food and pulls out a long hair. If you knew my sister, you'd know that's the one surefire way to gross her out.\n\nWaitress comes back and she points it out saying \"Just take this off my bill. I'm done\". Waitress says the manager will be over shortly to discuss our issues. That's the last we saw of her.\n\nManager came over and just said \"Who had the hair?\". My sister raised her hand.\n\nManager \"You want another one?\"\nSister \"No\"\nManager \"Do you want anything else? A muffin or something?\"\nSister \"No, I'm done\". Not even trying to hide her disgust at that point.\nManager \"Okay\" and she left. No mention of the other problems.\n\nAround the point of my sister finding the hair, we were all pretty loudly joking around about how horrible it was going, not berating the staff or anything, but still loud enough so the people close to us could hear the entire saga play out. I noticed one of the two groups near us getting pretty annoyed by it, with one lady in particular shooting dirty looks at us constantly.\n\nAbout 45 minutes pass and we still haven't gotten our bills, so my \"hair\" sister goes up to the register and comes back with a handful of tickets. After a few minutes of trying to sort through which one is who's, she realized all of ours were on one ticket, and the lady at the front desk just handed her all open tickets.\n\nShe goes back up front to work out who owes what, comes back a few minutes later saying it's all sorted out.\n\nAs we get up to leave I heard the older lady at the next booth say \"finally\" and her table all snickered.\n\nWe ended up with the bill split 3 ways, two of us got 50% off and one was just free. No apologies by any of the staff, and all of them and the customers at the one booth acting like it was all our fault.\n\nThis ended up being only the second time in my life I didn't leave a tip at all.\n\nAnyway, given how the other table was acting AITA, or were we the assholes for being upset and not tipping?\n\nTL;DR: Horrible service, orders screwed up so we didn't tip and had a reduced bill. Other customers and staff acted like we were the problem.",

      "description": "I got a dog while in a relationship. It was specifically discussed that if we broke up the dog would be mine (because I lost a dog in a previous breakup). Fast forward 8 months and me and the girlfriend break up. In the mix of that I find out I am leaving for a deployment. She says she will look after the dog and we will discuss what do to with the dog when I get back.\n\n Well after 2 weeks of not seeing the dog, we meet at the dog park so I can see him before I leave. Very cordial meeting until I tell her that I know when I get back, I am going to want him back. Well she thinks it is only fair that if I want him back she does not want to watch him for 11 months and have to give him back. She said this will be unfair for him to lose her and the other dog she had before we met. I told her if that is the case my family can watch him but they are in the middle of moving and they have 2 small dogs. He wont get to play with larger dogs like he does now and he will will be getting scalded constantly for playing too rough with the little guys. I will also have to scramble to get a new vet. \n\nSo I asked her if that is the case either I lose him now or the dog comes with me and doesn't have the nice life he will have with her. So I agreed to give him to her and not ask for him when I come back. AITA for still wanting him when I come back? \n\nBtw part of the reason we broke up is because of fibbing (see my first post) and I took this as the last test to prove to her I will never lie to her again.

      "description": "I’ve always been the type of person who plays it safe. Growing up, I was always taught to lock the doors at night, even though we were in a safe area. I’m at college now, and I still follow that line of thinking. My room is pretty close to our main door, and even though realistically no one would probably  stroll in, I feel safer with the door locked. My roommate doesn’t care quite as much, but he almost always does the same.\n\nLast night he went out to a party while I stayed in. I knew he would be coming back, but I didn’t know when. When I went to bed I locked the door as usual and thought nothing of it. As it turns out, he had left his key in the room and was locked out when he returned late at night. That meant he had to call someone to come up with a master and unlock the room, which no doubt took a long time. He tried to call/text me, but my phone was on do not disturb and I was fast asleep.\n\nHe managed to get back in, but I’m not sure when. I texted him today apologizing, but I’m not sure if I was in the wrong here.\n\nTL;DR: Locked my dorm room as I was going to sleep and accidentally locked my roommate out",

      "description": "So I'm a guy in college. So is my friend of 7 or so months. Her name is jamie We both suffer from anxiety, and we've bonded over that among other things. She's always told me her phone line is open if i need to talk. Some more background: she had an abusive ex named daniel who seemed like a shitty person. He made her cry constantly and called her degrading things. Also, I told her I have feelings for her a couple months ago, she said she wasnt ready and had valid reasons, but we continued our friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres's what happened: It's about 11:30 PM and i'm a little tipsy with my friend, when I receive a call from jamie. she's on acid and in a field. she asked if I could pick her up and come to my place. she then said she was with her friend daniel. I begin to have a panic attack, but say sure. I thought there was a possibility it's a different daniel, but I've never met the guy. I call her back and say I'll sober up then come to get her. \n\nI did NOT want her ex at my house. Bottom line. I don't like abusive people. On my way there, she calls and asks if I'm annoyed. I wasn't. I was just afraid to ask if she was with her ex. I pull over and call her, ask her if we can talk in private, and ask \"are you with your ex.\" I wasn't jealous, I just didn't want to bring a total piece of a shit into my house. She hung up on me. Honestly, that hurt my feelings a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a little over a week. I've called her twice. I really put a lot into friendships, even with my bros. It just hurts a lot to lose a friend with whom I confided and cared for. Over something so dumb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I told him I wasn't going to get him something so ridiculously expensive and completely unnecessary. Plus I'm positive he'll get bored with the novelty of it pretty quickly. He said it was what he wanted and I can't tell him \"no\" to a present he's asked for. My argument is that it's way more money than I was expecting us to spend on each other especially when we're trying to save for a deposit. He argues that it's what he's asked for and he was really excited by the idea of it and now I've ruined it for him.

She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?",

      "description": "My husband has a 4 yo whom I’ve been the adoptive mother to for over 3 years and we plan on having children once we work out our differences.\n\nTo cut it short, he says that I am “too controlling”, whereas I think he is “too flexible” (he gets sensitive when I call it “irresponsible”); as we are raising his child together, we have come across a lot of conflicts on how he should be raised. We have tried both ways and had conflicts. I have discussed and attempted to make compromises with him, but he gets upset and only wants it 100% his way. \n\nThe main issues:\n\n- I believe that most toddlers function better with a set schedule, as they will know what to expect as the day progresses and will less likely act out. He, on the other hand, thinks that with a schedule, especially one made by me, makes for the days to be nothing like he wants.\n\n- We have the most issues when it comes to his child’s eating. Since his kid has a small appetite, I try to get his daily calories/nutrients in 5 small meals (3 meals, 2 snacks) a day, and he eats relatively well with me. I encourage him to eat by conversing with him and teaching him new things as he eats. My SO, on the other hand, feels that if his child is hungry then he will ask for food, and if he doesn’t want to eat then it is okay; no encouragement necessary, and no need for “making up for it” throughout the day. This has made him underweight before. I would be okay if the skipping was not so frequent or if it were because of a family excursion, but otherwise it is not ideal.\n\n- Since I try to feed his child frequently, he poos around 3 times a day. This would tire my husband out as he would have to wash him sometimes, and this is one of the reasons why he wanted his child to eat less. As much as I understand that it can be tiring, I don’t think it is justifiable to make your child eat only a few bites every meal or skip meals because of that.\n\n- My SO works from home while I work as a dentist with a 9-5 schedule, and it gets tiring when I have to make up for the things his child has missed while having to also cook and do chores. This wouldn’t be an issue for me if his child was raised with a proper schedule, but because it is improvised when he’s with my husband, it gets stressful for me (and because he sees that I am stressed, he would say that if I had just went with his plan, I wouldn’t be stressed and everything will “eventually align”). \n\n- When his child didn’t want to eat vegetables, I would encourage him while having a bit of fun trying out a variety of vegetables together. My husband didn’t like the idea of that, and instead wanted to do it in a way where if we just gave his child only vegetables for a meal, he would eventually get too hungry and will then eat it. I did not think that this would resolve his child’s attitude towards vegetables, as he is only eating them out of desperation and not out of being open to them. \n",

      "description": "I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?",

      "description": "Ok so in my first year of college I had this really close group of friends comprised by myself, two dudes (dudeA and dudeB) and a girl (let's call her girlA). Over the course of the next few years the group grew in size, and while new arrivals were welcomed, we made it a point that whenever we went out it'd still be us only us 4, \"preserving\" the original group.  \nFast forward 4 years (today) and we're all over the place as we graduated and chose different paths.   \nThis year dudeA left for Madrid to continue his masters, and since in the 4 years we've known each other (I mean the 4 of us) we never got to take a trip together, I thought we three could go visit him for a few days for my birthday. All good right? Well.. During my last year in college I really bonded with another girl (girlB) who, just recently, became dudeA's gf. They're currently having a long distance relationship and they get to see each other a few times a month as she goes to visit him or he comes back. But since he left I'm practically this girl's ONLY friend here as she's from another city and she doesn't really get along with other people. Now remember girlA? Turns out all this time she's got a crush on dudeA, and obviously doesn't like girlB. So prefacing that between girlA (from the original group) and girlB I've grown MUCH closer to the latter, I now kind of had to make a choice to bring either one or the other as, if I invited one the other wouldn't come..   \nAnd in the end I chose girlA, for two reasons: firstly because we talked so much about taking this trip together (only us 4) and knew how much this meant to her, and secondly because I wanted to enjoy dudeA's company without his gf (girlB) as when they're together he acts a bit differently and isn't 100% himself and I haven't seen him in almost 5 months.  \nSo from girlB's perspective her \"best friend\" (if I can call myself that after doing this) is now going to see HER boyfriend for my birthday to which she practically isn't invited, AND I invited the one person she saw as her rival (girlA).   \nAm I an asshole for doing this? I feel like a piece of shit since she was really destroyed by this and sees it at a huge betrayal. My intention was never ever to hurt her in any way, but I selfishly prioritized the fact that I wanted my friend (dudeA) for myself.",

      "description": "Am I being used as a rebound? \n\nHe is a 25/m and I’m a 25/f. My ex recently asked me to go out to eat with him. We have been broken up for almost two years. We dated for six years prior to that. We have shared a lot of our growing up together. We haven’t spoken in over a year. He recently told me that he is generally really happy with his life except for his relationship with his gf as he doesn’t think they’re compatible. Yet he has always told me he didn’t think they’d work but he would give it a shot and ultimately he saw us being together but we had to mature. \n\nSo we basically talked for six hours until five am the other night about life, our goals, how we have matured, and what our ever changing perspectives of life are. \n\nSo he told me that he has been thinking about past good times a lot because he tends to do that when he is sad. I inquired further and he said he was thinking about what positive things have lead him to where he is now and how I influenced him a lot. He said that he is sad because of his girlfriend situation and how they’re so different and that he thought they could grow together over time but it isn’t happening. He told me he had the crazy obsessive butterfly feeling with me that he didn’t have with her and that he and I were so similar and attached at the hip for like five years. I reminded him we met as teenagers and hormones probably Played a role in that and also we have jobs and lives now. \n\nI also said people are so different and I’ve always wondered if we got along so well because we knew each other for so long and were so similar and saw the world the same or if that kind of grew over time. I said I wondered this with other people who I dated who were up to par but I wasn’t crazy about them. He agreed. We also discussed what we enjoyed about each other and took for granted when we were dating and I shared how I matured as a person and individual and focused on not being dependent in any way on another person (being alone and single caused me so much anxiety before). He didn’t say much in how he matured except for he appreciated people’s emotions now whereas they annoyed him before. He still focused on how much he tries to learn about technology. \n\nWe couldn’t stop talking for hours and he gave me a very extended hug after our talk and we left and haven’t spoken since. It’s been a week. He said it was amazing to talk to me and that he may want to catch up again in the future. \n\nHe is still with him girlfriend and has never said anything well about her ever. \n\nI am worried I am a rebound for him as he is having these discussions with me while still having a gf. He hasn’t been single since we broke up and am wondering if he just is afraid of being alone. \n\n**TLDR: ex and I talked. He said stuff like he didn’t appreciate me when we were together and his perspectives have changed. He is still dating his gf who he has never spoken positively about. I am wondering if I am just being used as a rebound**",

      "description": "   This happened years ago in middle school, but is still a point my aunt likes to bring up at family functions in order to highlight my moral failings, so I have to know.\n   Some background: When I was in 7th grade my regular teacher left on maternity leave and was replaced by my cousins (then) fiancé. To be honest, 7th grade was by no stretch my best year. \n   Anyway, one day we were about to take a quiz on some chapter of a book I obviously didn’t read and was doomed to fail. The papers were handed out and I realized I didn’t have a pencil (which was typical) so I turned to the class and asked if anyone had one.  \n   That’s when the very awkward, kind of lonely, girl offered me hers. When my aunt tells this part she typically goes into a long winded and detailed account where she insinuates that the girl wasn’t just handing me a pencil but an extension of her trust and hope. \n    As soon as the pencil was in my hands, a friend (described by my aunt as a “knucklehead”) next to me said he didn’t have a pencil either. So, without thinking, I broke the one that I had borrowed and gave him the other half.  This is where s*** hit the fan. I heard an audible gasp, and to this day I’m unsure if it was the girl or my aunt. It was probably both.\n   After the quiz I returned both halves of the pencil, which the girl then spent the next fifteen minutes taping back together. I did not apologize (or at least I can’t remember if I did). I honestly don’t think I should have anticipated such an attachment to a pencil at 12 y/o. But I’ve been hearing about this for almost two decades so I have to know AITA?",

      "description": "FACTS:\nI own a 2 bed 1 bath home and rent the other room to him and him only.\nThere's him, me, my gf and our 2 pets living here. \nHe started this relationship 2 months ago\nHis gf has a young child and she has her own place.\n\nBackstory: So they have only just begun dating and after just a couple dates he was introduced to her daughter. Personally that seems too soon and unleathy for the daughter. Now they've been dating for 2 months and he seems to be trying to fill a father role and he invites them over to spend the night in my cramped house and never gives me a heads up. Without warning there is a 4 yr old in the house and my house is not child proof at all and my dog is still young and not fully socialized to kids so although he is very friendly, he isn't always aware he can knock the kid over or inadvertently bite when hes chomping on his toys. It scares me that I may not be around to watch him when they leave child unsupervised with the dog.  \n\nAs for the house, there are many expensive things and there has been many spills and already slightly ruined things. We have left out cleaning products and sharp objects are not uncommon around the house. \n\nThe child is sometimes left unattended in the common area while they are alone in his room with the door shut. When they all stay the night they are all crammed into his bed. It seems unhealthy that this child should be forced to sleep in a bed with a relatively new person, practically still a stranger.  WIBTA for telling him that it's not fair to the child to have to be so involved with the mothers new bf at this early stage in a relationship as well as having to sleep with them in his bed in a house that's not his with basically my whole other family living there? And also that its not fair to me that hes putting me in this awkward situation where I have to be responsible for watching the unattended kid in a MY now extremely cramped house?\n\nTL;DR My roommate brings his brand new gf and her young kid to stay at my cramped house with my overly friendly dog and non child friendly house and also they all sleep together crammed into a small room on one bed.

      "description": "(Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile) I've always been very close to my friend (let's call her Louise for the sake of privacy) since the beginning of the last school year. We spent lots of awesome moments together, and lots of laughs, although sometimes, I feel like she does take me for granted. For example, she once called me in a panick because she needed a place to stay at night, and kindly agreed. Then, the next day, she tried negotiating for another free day at my place. I refused. But today, we had some work to do together in class, and when I turned to her and asked her to start, she just sighed and said: \"Ugh, this is pissing me off, I don't give a shit\". Probably meaning 'do it for me'. Now, I'm that kind of person who always does the work, because I just hate arguing for nothing. I told her that she had to try at least. She refused, and replied that she didn't ask to be there or with me. Of course, I got a bit offended, and replied that neither did I. She then left the class to go to the bathroom, supposedly to cry. We haven't talked since. Am I the asshole ?\n\n(tl;dr: AITA for refusing to do my friend's work for her and making her cry ?)",

I always got along really well with them and considered them my favorite grandparents. So I took them out to eat and told them what happened and what ive been going through. I explained that I work full time and being homeless is actually kind of expensive and its causing troubles saving money. I asked if they would let me live with them for 30 days while I get myself situated. They have a 4 bedroom home and live alone. I offered to pay rent. They refused.

      "description": "So, my class had a quiz on derivatives today in Calculus, a quiz that was probably the hardest one Ive written yet. I stayed up til 1:30 amish trying to study for it. While Im writing, I notice a kid I kind of know using his calculator and talking to the person in front of him during the quiz (its a no-calculator quiz). I was pretty pissed off cuz he was doing it over and over as well, so I wrote down \"(Cheater) is cheating\" on my quiz and went up pretending to ask the teacher a question. While I was asking, I pointed to what I wrote, and the first thing my teacher did was read it out loud.\n\n\"(Cheater) is cheating\".\n\nMy heart sank immediately, and I knew he definitely heard cuz my teacher said it fairly loudly, and his name being in the message likely caught his attention. I don't think my teacher meant to read it out on purpose cuz he probably didnt know it was supposed to be for his eyes/ears only. He just said \"Yeah, I know\" which made it worse, so I just went back and sat down. The cheater was staring at me right after, and now I feel like shit. He is Chinese as well, and he's connected to a whole group of Chinese kids that are known for cheating (since they can whisper in mandarin so the teacher doesnt understand if he hears), so Im probably gunna be getting glares from that group in the hallways for the rest of my high school career. I'm not sure what I did was right or wrong, but I have little respect for chronic cheaters so it felt right at the time. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR - Gave note to teacher telling him somebody was cheating, teacher read it out loud alerting the cheater that I was snitching on him, and he and his entire group probably hates me now.",

There's another person sitting to my right, leaving the chairs at the ends of the arc empty. There were plenty of tables empty elsewhere in the shop.\n\nI was listening to an audio book AND very obviously actively engaged in a mobile game (phone screen can be seen by everyone at a glance) when a man sits down to my left. He immediately tries to converse with me. I didn't hear him at first, but I eventually catch sight of the orientation of his body and that he's gesturing at me. I discreetly lower the volume on my book. He's trying to ask me about the weather. \n\nI got a weird feeling. I justified it then by telling myself that a stranger trying so hard to get another stranger's attention about the weather is being weird, especially when one party is otherwise distracted. Now I'm not sure. \n\nWas I an asshole for ignoring him?\n\nWe did end up in the same Hospitality Grocery Store an hour later. Again, I had my earphones in. Again, he tried to engage me. This time, he physically got in my way, so I couldn't just pretend he wasn't there. When I took out my earphones, he asked me if I had a boyfriend. I told him to leave me alone. I feel justified in *that* course of action. \n\nI'm unsure of my actions in Overpriced Coffee Shop, though. \n\nTL;DR Stranger tries really hard to get me talking while I'm listening to audio book.

      "title": "AITA? I’m dating my ex-bestfriend’s ex",
      "description": "Long story, don’t judge without reading the whole thing\n\nSome background info into this friendship first:\n\nLast year I had this best friend who I was constantly there for, no matter what. We saw each other almost everyday, because we were taking some of the same classes. We were honestly really great friends and we were like “platonic soulmates” \n\nWhen we had been friends for about a year, and she started turning on me. She started saying I was a lesbian and I was coming onto her, which I was not, and I am not. I tried resolving the situation and eventually I did, but our friendship wasn’t the same. \n\nLater, I had an issue that was really bothering me and I wanted to talk to her about it, because she was the only one I felt that I could talk to, but she ran away from me. Literally, turned around and ran when I tried to walk up to her. \n\nOnto the main issue:\n\nMy friend had started talking with this older guy, and invited him over to her house when she was home alone and they had sex. She felt really guilty and told me about it, and I supported her through everything she went through with him when she broke up with him. (She was waiting for marriage, and all her family would have put her down for just giving herself away like that) \n\nA few weeks after she told me they had sex, she told me that they did it without a condom. She quickly followed that statement up with the fact that she didn’t consent to it. I told her she was raped, and offered to talk to her parents/police with her but she wouldn’t do anything.\n\nI had a talk with the guy she accused, telling him he was a rapist and she never wanted to see or hear from him again, in not so nice terms. He was very offended that he was accused of rape and tried to tell me his side of the story, but I wouldn’t listen. \n\nA few months down the road, my friend told me she had lied about being raped. She said she didn’t want anyone to look at her any differently. I was completely ashamed that I had just believed her and accused the guy that I didn’t even know of something so horrible that he hadn’t even done, so I reached out to him to apologize. We got to talking and I realized he was actually a really great guy who needed a friend. I became a good friend to him. \n\nDuring this time, I was still friends with my friend, but we weren’t good friends. After the classes were over, I texted her and told her I was through trying to be there for her when she wouldn’t be there for me. I also let her know that I was this guys friend, and I was sorry she had accused him of something he hadn’t done because he was actually a really decent guy.\n\nFast forward a couple months, I realize how compatible this guy and I are. We start dating, and he is nothing but a gentleman. He wouldn’t even kiss me until I kissed him, and I had to reassure him that I wanted to. He’s been nothing but a gentleman with me and I fell in love. I told my then ex-bestfriend that I was dating him and I loved him, and she got really mad at me and started harassing me and him and trying to break us up. \n\nIt’s been a while since then, but since I’ve found this subreddit I thought I should find out from y’all, was I in the wrong in this situation? I know the whole thing about never dating your best friends ex, but with the situation it didn’t seem as bad? I don’t know, y’all tell me. ",

      "title": "AITA for putting my garbage bags in my neighbors garbage bin?",
      "description": "I was on the phone with my best friend as I was bringing in my garbage bins from the curb. Two bins, one for garbage, and one for recycle. These are the big, plastic 40-gallon bins that make it easy for the garbage crew to dump the contents into the open top of the truck.\n\nI put the recycle bin back into my yard, and went back to go bring the garbage bin. When I pulled it back towards the curb, it hadn’t yet been emptied.\n\nSome background: I leave my bins out next to my other neighbors’ bins, sort of small convenience for the garbage crew- they only have to make the one stop for 4 of the houses that comprise the cul-de-sac.\nRather than leave my bin there and come back later, I checked my neighbor’s bin, and saw that he had practically nothing in it. I transferred my own 4 full garbage bags into his bin, and started to haul mine back to my yard.\n\nI narrated this to my friend as I was doing it.\n\nHe told me to stop, and told me that I was being an asshole for doing that. He said it would be better if I just go back and get the bin after it is emptied, like everyone else.\n\nA bit more background: I live in a HOA neighborhood, where part of the dues we pay goes towards garbage removal. Other than the HOA dues, or if you want large pick-up on day that isn’t already designated for large pick up (they do this twice per year), we do not pay for garbage removal. Even if we did, my neighbor’s one big bin wasn’t even 1 quarter of the way full, as we have weekly pickup, and my bags filled his to about 3 quarters full.\n\nI relayed this information to my friend, and he still said, “Call it what you want, but you’re still an asshole.”\n\nMy issue is that my friend was so adamant that I was an asshole, and in fact ended the call very abruptly as soon as I refused to do what he must have felt was the right thing. I later talked to my wife about it, and she said she didn’t see it. Thinking back on it, we came up with the idea that, had the garbage not been picked up that day, my neighbor would be inconvenienced the extra trash in his bin that I put there. It was a moot point, however, since the garbage bins were picked up later. I saw the truck pass on my doorbell video when the motion alert came up (big trucks always trigger the motion alert).\n\nI intend to call my friend back and chat it out with him, but this is pretty late for him, and it’s on my mind, so I figured I would ask and get some perspective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL; DR: My friend thinks I am an asshole for putting my garbage in my neighbor’s nearly-empty bin so that I didn’t have to go back and get the bin after it was collected later on that day.\n\nWhat do you think, AITA’ers? Am I an asshole for putting my garbage bags in my neighbors garbage bin?",

While this is a donation on behalf of our business it will be funded by employees out of our own pockets, the business itself is not contributing anything. To be clear, I have no issue donating to charity and do make a yearly contribution to a cause I believe in. My reservation is that I am basically being peer pressured into making this donation whether I really want to or not. It was suggested in a staff meeting with everyone present which made it very difficult to say no. It also bothers me that the business will essentially be taking credit for the donation which to me seems like it’s more about making the business look good as opposed to donating to a charity because you believe in the cause and want to support it. For context it’s not a lot of money, $60 each, but for me that’s not the point.

      "title": "AITA for lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up at the emergency room?",
      "description": "I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). \n\nI had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. \n\nThe date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. \n\nWhen the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, \"Does the Guac have onions?\" To which she responded, \"Yes, it does\".  I then proceeded to tell her, \"I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?\" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, \"are you really allergic?\" To which I said \"no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac\". She was pretty impressed like \"damn, I'm stealing this one\". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. \n\nThe rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. \n\nThe first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  \n\n(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) \n\nCutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, \"I barely got any onions in the bite\". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. \n\nAfter leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  \n\nHe kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , \"Okay\". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. \n\nAt the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. \"Thank you so much for everything.\" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. \n\nHere I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g\nAnother nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, \"I think I might have been having an allergic reaction\". He says, \"Are you allergic to anything?\" And I go \"No\". \n\nHe gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault. Sorry for the long text, but AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "So, I'm in high school. I have this one guy I've been friends with for quite a few years. He's always been very religious, to the point he pleaded with me not to be \"too gay\" when I came out. Whatever that was four years ago, people change.\nRegardless of his religion, he has some mildly annoying quirks. Pretends to play the piano in class, sometimes hums and sings, never directly asks for help and copies other peoples' work instead, that sort of stuff that is just enough to annoy you but not really good enough to confront him. He also has very little social awareness, doesn't really know when someone doesn't want to talk or wants to end a conversation. There have been a few occasions where he's touched me, which has always been a thing I object to with just about everyone (I've always valued personal space pretty heavily).\nA few weeks ago, his behaviours got worse. The only class I have with him is maths, which I also share with a close female friend. I have no idea how the conversation started between the two, but they ended up talking about religion. Said female friend and I are both atheists, which he knows, but nonetheless, he preached to her for what was probably at least half an hour. The end of the speech ended with something about saving her and included an invitation to his church, which she declined.\nEver since then, his behaviours that used to bug us a bit have become way worse. He provides unsolicited advice,  explains concepts to us we already understand and just generally is more of a distraction in class than anything. As my female friend sits next to him, she takes more than I do, but we're both at the point of wanting to move away from him. We've been discussing asking the teacher to rearrange the class seating so we don't have to be near him, but when I bring it up to other friends who aren't in the class they say I'm being too hard on him. I don't want to confront him directly to avoid anyone being alienated or feeling unwanted. So, WIBTA for doing this?",

      "description": "First post, so I’m sorry for bad formatting. My wife and I were heading to bed, and went to tell our son to brush his teeth and go to bed as well.\n\nAs we headed down the hallway, we saw our son with his back turned to the door playing with a tall block structure. When suddenly, it falls over, he immediately whispers “aw shit.” \n\nMy wife quickly began motioning for me to go in their with a scowl on her face. I on the other hand, was grinning. \n\nWe both mutually decided to head to our bedroom to discuss first before we go into our sons room. Since it would’ve been conflicting stances and would most likely make my wife look bad because I would be on his side.\n\nHere’s our conversation, it’s not exact but it’s fresh in my mind.\n\nWife: Why were you smiling? We shouldn’t let him swear, we aren’t trying to teach him bad manners.\n\nMe: He never swears in front of us ever. If we barged in and scolded him right then and there, he would be startled and be reluctant to just leave the door open in the future.\n\nWife: That’s kind of a stretch, we would be teaching him it’s okay to swear in private. We don’t want him to be saying this in school and get in trouble by his teachers.\n\nMe: Whats wrong with that? He’s not swearing excessively, this is the first time we’ve heard it. That’s what kids do, we swore when we were younger and we’re fine.\n\nWife: I don’t know, there’s no point in scolding him anymore. I’m going to bed.\n\nMe: Alright, I’ll help him get ready for bed. \n\nMy wife was angry afterwards I could tell, not a ton, but more like frustrated. I’m pretty sure I’m in the right here, we’re doing great in general though. \n\nThis wasn’t a huge fight and I know we’ll make amends tomorrow. Just wanted to know if you wise Redditors have any advice or feedback so I can apologize where it’s due.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I’ve moved 15+ times in 18 years, so friendships dying off is normal, except I definitely needed my friends from a year ago when I was going through that rough time, and I feel like I should have continued our friendships because they tried to help me through that time in my life. \n\nNo one actually called me out for being an asshole, but I guess when I see people talk about ghosting others I kind of feel like that’s what I did, intentionally or otherwise.

      "description": "I feel guilty for ignoring her but over the past few months Ive been increasingly irritated with her and how she treats me. We had a bit of a falling out and Ive had no interest in rekindling any type of friendship with her but shes been trying to reach out again. I don't think I over reacted but I feel bad because she's pregnant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis situation starts back in July, my mom passed and I was doing so much to organize her funeral while I was also already moving. Now my mom and I did not have a good relationship by a long stretch and she didn't get along well with people so...I didn't expect many people to show anyway. I did however believe my friend who I will be calling Karen was going to be there she said as much right up to the day of the funeral only to have her call less than half an hour before hand that she wouldn't be coming as she was tired (I understand, she had told me that she was a month or two pregnant days prior so I wasn't going to make a thing out of it). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe used to talk every few days but when I would message her it would go unanswered about 2/3 of the time. Even then I didn't let it get to me, shes going through huge changes shes stressed and all. but then when we would talk she would more and more often just start conversations like she had already told me other pertinent information. I'd say no we didn't and shed start insisting we did even though she could look back and she in our messages that she clearly didn't and she hasn't spoken to me over the phone in months. She just laughs it off and continues but I hate when this happens. It feels as if she's mistaking me with her an imaginary friend version of myself or something. I get that shes busy and I'm not trying to say she need to spend more time with me I just want to feel like we both see the friendship the same way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe falling out was over her tying to get me take in her new cat that wasn't getting along with her dog. First I was annoyed because after about two weeks of messaging her and not hearing back she suddenly has a huge message for me about how she cant keep that cat it doesn't get along with the dog but hey I love cats so I'll take it in right. After a lot of clarification because even on this she insisted that she already told me the cat wasn't getting along with the dog.  I said if she could line up another home for it I can take care of the cat until then so it wouldn't be so stressed with the dog, as the conversation goes on it comes out shes done nothing to actually help them get along just lock the cat away in the room all day then let the dog in there at night so now the poor things too scared to leave under her bed. I was so bloody pissed at this point that, that is even how she was taking care of the cat. I just told her i had to head out but i would take the cat (didn't want it to have to stay like that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day I try to talk to her, nothing give it another day and message her again still nothing. Oh at this point its probably important to add that she was also expecting me to make a cake for her baby shower (Shaped like an elephant and big enough o feed 20 people. For Free) Id been having some money trouble and since we hardly talked I never had the ability to tell her about this and now its a few weeks away i cant get a hold of her to tell her I cant afford to make this thing. (Plus baby shower gift with everything on her registry being $50+) I contact another friend of her who was doing the shower planning to let them know. And what do ya know Karen is suddenly able to message me again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKaren: Heyy sorry for lateness. So our last conversation rubbed me the wrong way. lol it just frustrated me that i was constantly being interrupted which led to me sidetracking the initial story. Anyways i wanted a few days to cool down. I'm sorry for ignoring you, i love you! I hope your doing well \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: i know i can interrupt a bit sometimes but its really hard to have a conversation when it seem like your telling a story from the middle, some interrupting began to feel necessary for context. then you say how you thought we talked about something already. almost every time we talk at all that happens. i Know your busy and with good reason, there's a lot going on but every time that happens it feels like I'm not even a real person in your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKaren:  Now if you don't bother to listen long enough to anything of course your going to feel like your not getting all of the story...i don't want to turn this into an argument, i just wanted to let you know how i was feeling. Im sorry you feel like Ive kept you so out of the loop, i can understand why. Its been difficult to keep in touch with everyone and i appreciate your patience. I don't have any set plans to be at moms this coming week but i will be over there at some point in the week, could we have a much needed hangout? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't respond to that and a couple days later I realized that she blocked me on fb. I was so upset, she told me how she was feeling, and that's fine but if i say how Ive been feeling then its suddenly a problem and \"she doesn't want to start an argument\". About a week or two after that she calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKaren: ill be in the area tomorrow mind if i stop by tomorrow afternoon i want to smooth this over?\n\nMe:Ill be home just let me know before you stop by.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I'm waiting, and waiting nothing by 4pm I assume she isn't coming or forgot or some shit. Then I get a call at 7pm!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKaren: Is 8 to late to stop by?\n\nme: That's probably the broadest take on afternoon I've ever head.\n\nKaren: Yeah that was poor judgment on my part, when are you free this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was on December 9th, after that I just ignored her, I just couldn't care.  But then this morning shes calling me again, I didn't answer and she left a text asking to stop by. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShes ready to pop levels of pregnant now and I feel like its just her pregnancy that I feel guilty about this at all but I don't know... AITA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr- Pregnant friend says she would go to my moms funeral flakes day of, and hardly responds to messages. Seems to have an imaginary friend of myself or something as nearly every conversation has her saying several times \"really I'm sure i told you about this\"  I finally got pissed about how she was treating her cat and had just had it. she calls wants to come over to work things out, we make plans and she doesn't show and doesn't call until hours later. i haven't talked to her since\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit, on mobile sorry for formatting. Long time lurker, first time poster to this sub. Sorry for the wall of text, backstory is needed.\n\nSo like the title says, my father and I got into a huge fight a couple months back. Things have always been rocky between us ever since I was around 11 or 12, because he’s always had terrible anger issues and I started dealing with depression and anxiety at a young age because of it. I started letting my grades slip and started not wanting to do any kind of work in school and at that point my father thought that I was a complete failure and would be no more than a \"lying, conniving fox\". Thing is, because of his anger, I would lie and hide things from him. Wouldn't any normal child do the same? Knowing that your parent would go off on you. Things got worse and worse to the point that he started beating me. I remember very vividly one time he grabbed me by my hair, was dragging me around the floor and threw me against the wall. \n\nFast forward to fight. My dad had gotten mad when he picked up my daughter from pre-k and thought he saw my ex's name on the box where it's signed who dropped her off in the morning. (Whole other story, but he's not a good person and it's why he's an ex now) I know for a fact that I dropped her off. He insisted he saw another name. I started getting upset because I KNEW I was innocent, and started yelling at him and letting out how he doesn't trust me from back then and that I have issues because of it, and that I would be seeing a therapist soon because of him. He yelled back at me and was saying \"bullshit, there's nothing wrong with you. A therapist won't tell you crap\" at this point I'm fuming and am so upset I'm bawling, and start telling my daughter to get in the car and we're leaving. My dad then says \"don't you take it out on her, she didn't do anything wrong\" to which I said \"why? You beat me whenever you were mad at me. She's my daughter, I can discipline her the way I want\" (I would never treat her the way he did, I was just so angry) and he said \"because you deserved it. You did that shit on your own. You lay a hand on her, I'll call CPS, same way you did on me\" (I did call once cause I was bleeding and bruised so bad, but they never did anything) at this point I don't even say anything and leave. The last text I have from him after that fight was Jan. 10. I haven't not spoken to him since, have not seen him and don't go around him anymore. \nWhen I did see my therapist, I told her everything that happened with my father and how it has affected me in that I am terrified of confrontation and someone being upset or mad with me. She ended up diagnosing me with PTSD, anxiety and severe depression. I told my sister who told my mom, who I know told my dad. But he still hasn't said anything to me. I ended up getting a service dog and she's been wonderful, but now I'm starting to doubt myself.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Im 17 and my manager is in her mid 20's and shes super cool and we talk and laugh ect, so we have a pretty good relationship. She does with everyone I work with. She got pregnant a while ago and one person I work with decided to have a baby shower for her, for just the people at work. Will call this woman kate. So where I work theres only like 10 people who work there so we're all pretty close so I see why someone would do this. I close the store with Kate pretty often so shes one of the people I know really well. I got to work one day last week and kate told me about this baby shower and told me its on the 27th (a sunday). I said that works because sundays are my free days. \n\n\nIm a really busy person right now. Im in band and theres a lot of after school ensembles Im in. If you add up work, school, and band, Im busy for 68-70 hours a week. Everyday (except sunday) is a 9 or 12 hour day. Sundays are my \"free days\" but I still got work for 5 hours on sundays. Sundays are the days I get to relax. But I also do chores on sundays. I don't really have a lot of free time and its been like this since November and it'll finally be over in April. Then Ill just have school and work which will be like 50 hours. And if it was April Id be down for this baby shower but I look forward to my sundays where I get an extra hour of sleep and I get to play video games. \n\nThe baby shower is at 1pm and I guess I could wake up at like 10 and get my chores done in like an hour. I gotta be back at work at 4:30 and I don't know when this baby shower is gonna be over.\n\nIdk just Im just so busy right now and its super overwhelming, especially since I never did much of anything a year ago. I would just go to school and come home and play video games for 10 hours then play video games all weekend. Finding time right now is super difficult. But I think everyone at work is going to this and Id feel like an asshole being the only one not going\n\nTL;DR lm really busy and dont have a lot of free time and I got invited to a baby shower that everyone I work with is gonna be at and I really just don't wanna go",

      "description": "Background: We've been friends for almost a year now. We started hanging out thanks to a mutual friend who brought us both out one night. Then we hung out at least 3 times a week. They started dating someone and started to change, they were spending all of their time with them and completely blew me off.\n\nFast forward to this month, a trip had been planned months in advance and was happening no matter what. I convinced myself to stay positive about the situation and give this person a real chance on this trip. We get on the plane, no surprises so far. The person begins to do little petty things there, but I continued to ignore them and make the best of it. The last day comes and we head off to turn in the rental car, which is where the disaster starts.\n\nWe go up to the desk after the car was checked, I'm thinking everything is good and looking forward to getting on the plane home asap. Some papers got screwed so we ended up with a bill that was a $100 more than originally quoted. I told my friend that they should just dispute it with their credit card company, no sense in going back and forth with the people at the desk.\n\nAs we're walking away from the desk, their face gets bright red. They whip around, immediately blaming me for screwing up, even though the fault didn't fall on either of us. They storm off, which is fine; I'm not going to deal with their hysterics. They text and call their s/o the entire time, ignoring me. The plane home is full. I find two seats next to each other, gesturing for us to sit, my friend says they would rather sit elsewhere and proceed past me.\n\nHere's the dilemma:\n\nThis person requested half of the money for the car rental from me before we had even gotten a seat near the terminal, and they requested way more than the car rental had amounted to. I ignored this request and gave them half of what they had been charged on their card, which is what I had agreed to pay. They requested $255 from me, as my half, when the car rental only came to $418, meaning that I would only owe them $209 instead of the $255 that they're upcharging me for. I sent them the $209 and explained that we could discuss the rest after the credit card company decided on what they are going to do with the disputed amount, which had not been charged yet. So this person has been on my ass about the difference between the amounts, which is $46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Everything on the trip had been paid for for this person, they did NOT pay for their hotel, their park tickets, any parking, a few meals, and did not ONCE say thank you for any of it.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that this whole thing is a shame because we had such a great friendship, but I don't think I should back down after everything I've done for them and pay them an extra $46 after they hadn't paid for anything else.\n\nI would love to hear any/all thoughts/advice on this, and if you have any questions or need anything clarified please ask!",

      "description": "We're a group of friends from high school, now in college. Every now and then we hike up a local hill as a meetup. One of the friends, let's call him \"James\" has a penchant for luxury goods like watches, clothes, etc. This will tie in to the story later.\n\nI organized for us to meet again last saturday. James was hesitant at first because it had rained the previous day. I thought he was just trying to dodge so I called him a pussy for being afraid of the rain. After some heckling, he agreed to go with us.\n\nThe hike was great, we had drinks at the top and proceeded to return down. When we got to our cars he completely flipped out about how his 200$ shoes are destroyed because of the mud. I told him that he should have worn something else, but all our other friends agreed with him in saying it's my fault. We have not spoken since.\n\nI feel kinda bad because I heckeled him into coming with us. Is it really my fault for destroying his expensive shoes? AITA? ",

      "description": "SO works nights. Goes in in the late afternoon and gets out between 2-4am most days. Our baby is 5mo old and she pretty much sleeps through the night. She went to bed at 11pm last night which is early for her. She usually sleeps like 2am-2pm (she is too young to sleep train yet). So she fell asleep before her bedtime bottle and wasn't in an overnight diaper just a regular diaper. I figured she'd wake up around the time he got home. He seemed okay with the possibility of feeding her when he got home last night when I talked to him like an hour before he got home. I was asleep when he got home at 3:30/4am. She ended up waking up at 7am and he was still awake. As he puts it he was just getting sleepy and ready to try going to sleep. \n\nWe each wanted the other to do the feeding. I was asleep and he woke me up telling me I needed to feed her. I stood my ground that he should do it because he was actually awake and he should do at least one feeding a day. He still thinks I was wrong and heartless to make him feed her this morning. It was 10 hours before he had to be at work and she slept practically until he left for work only waking once more at 11 at which time I got up and fed her careful not to wake him. I am not back to work yet because we've been down to one car but I just feel like one feeding a day isn't too much to ask.  Usually his one feeding a day is around 2pm when she first wakes up and he is fine doing it but last night she woke up and it was unfortunate for everyone.\n\nAm I the asshole for making him feed her this morning?",

      "description": "Am I the asshole? \nSo I don't really know how to start this so a little bit of background knowledge\n\nI met this girl in the middle of 8th grade, quite frankly we hated each other but there was still a connection. In ninth grade we talked most every day, we took the bus together and told each other all our problems and just came to be very close friends, considering we're both retarded (not really just really dumb) we end up being together in summer school. We spent every moment of basically every day together. It goes without saying that I fell in love with her and caught hard feelings,\n\nSo in Beginning of 11th grade  rather the summer leading up to it, I figured I should've just told her and we'll I did just that, she gave me the usual aww and hug and all that, but the next few months were really the problem and even starter basically the next day, so some guy had asked her out that day and she liked him but that want the issue, usually she'd tell me everything but when the guy blocked her for whatever reason she wouldn't tell me a thing and still told me about how the guy was like her perfect match and whatever, but this is only really the beginning, so she introduced me to some teen dating app and of course she was on it too, and she got a lot of guys and girls, the thing that hurt me though was she told me everything, every guy she had been with or was talking to. This one time she got with this guy and on snapchat despite not having talked for a while she had just sent me a Pic of the dude saying that she had just fucked him, and the next 2 or so days  texted that I should probably go steal her some plan B. In short the next few months were just her telling me about the dudes she fucked and like her boyfriends and shit. One time I had asked to hang out and come the day tells me that she forgot and made plans with another dude pretty sure he fingered her in the movies, I don't know how I stayed so stuck on this girl but I did.\n\nI blocked her and told her most everything. She said damn she was sorry, a week later I started analyzing things, I had begun to feel guilty I felt that I had left her without knowing her side of the story, I called her on Christmas and told her that and she just made me feel worse, I don't know whether to call her or not\n\nMaybe I didn't give you guys enough information but of what I have was I the asshole? \nTL:DR ;Fell in love with my best friend she starts telling me about every guy she's been with, dump her as a friend WITA\n\nEdit: So I ended up talking to her about it and a ton of of other stuff concerning its been a wild week, and though I critisized her for a lot she told me a ton of things about me that even if I'm aware of I haven't changed so I've come to the realization that I didn't give enough information and it turns out that we were both in the wrong and I was as toxic to her for wanting constant attention as possible as she was toxic to me thanks anyways R/aita",

      "description": "One of my closest friends of 10 years, Sarah, is getting married this year. \n\nWhen Sarah and her partner first got together, there were problems from the get-go. The partner was emotionally abusive and just a downright awful person. Sarah would message me out of nowhere with long rants about their behaviour every few months, sometimes including screenshots where this person had said things to her that were just way out of line.  My response was always basically to listen, be there when she needed to vent, and sometimes gently encourage her to walk away. \n\nThe thing is, our friendship basically died as soon as they got together. We’ve seen each other face-to-face maybe three times in the past year and a half that they’ve been together. At first I chalked this up to the “honeymoon period”, but later, I think Sarah felt uncomfortable communicating with me when things were relatively stable in her relationship, given she’d told me all these horrible details about the bad times. They ended up getting engaged and she asked me to be in her bridal party. \n\nOn the few occasions I’ve met her partner, I’m civil. This person can be quite charismatic and manipulative, and I think they don’t like me because I see through it.\n\nA few months ago, after Sarah and I hadn’t spoken in a good five or six months, I requested we meet face-to-face and addressed our drift head-on. She took full responsibility and promised to make more of an effort. She also said the relationship is going really well these days. All in all, we had a pleasant night. \n\nI haven’t seen her since. Our last communication was when I texted a couple of weeks later and asked how she was going and she never responded. But I’m still getting wedding updates (via group emails, not directly to me) and it’s expected that I’ll be there. It’s a destination wedding that will set me back around $1500 (which is a lot of money for me, but I’d be there for a close friend in a heartbeat). \n\nI feel disingenuous attending when I don’t approve of the relationship, and also am not sure if I really exist to Sarah as anything more than a “crisis friend” when things go bad. I’m weighing up whether I should just go, or have to fully explain to her why I won’t be attending (her absence, my sentiment towards the partner, etc). I realise the latter will officially end our friendship. \n\nWIBTA if I didn’t go to the wedding? \n\n",

Friend two smokes occasionally, but always *pretends* to be completely stoned because said friend tries to be like friend one.\n\nAny time I hang out with both friends, I am always the one to drive, because even though I *used* to smoke, I don’t like to anymore and haven’t for a couple of years. I’ve mentioned before that “one of you guys should drive some time” to which friend two replies “hell nah!” \n\nEach time we hang out, it’s really up in the air whether or not one of them will bring weed into my car. In my state, marijuana is illegal, so I demand to know if somebody has some, so if I am stopped, I don’t end up lying to the officer by not knowing there was pot. I’ll often ask “do either of you have anything?” and friend two will lie and say “no,” then several minutes into our drive, he’s using a wax pen.\n\nThe incident: I’ve been getting sick of this slowly for a while, but I lost it a little bit the other night. Friends one and two were high, and I was driving them to a fast food restaurant. \n\nFriends one and two are aware that I have allergy induced asthma, and that I do not carry an inhaler.\n\nFriend two takes a bottle of cheap perfume from friend two insists “we all smell like weed,” (I certainly didn’t, but maybe they did?) and sprays himself, *me,* my car seats, and friend one. This occurred the previous week, and I told friend one he couldn’t spray that stuff around me. I guess that went unnoticed.\n\nMaybe five minutes later, my throat begins to itch, my eyes are watering like crazy, and I’m coughing and wheezing. I say “That was shitty, dude.” Friend two says “Aw she mad!!!!” and nothing else.\n\nI pull my car off into a parking lot and roll down my windows. I said something to the extent of “Yanno what? I’m really sick of this. I’m constantly driving your stoned asses around, and you bring your weed in the car even though I could get into trouble for it. You’re constantly pretending to be so high you can’t function, and you spray this perfume around me to the point of me having trouble breathing.” I then call friend two an asshole.\n\n\n",

I have shared my concerns about this with him. \n\nWhile he sits there and does nothing. \n\nI have suspicions that he's partaking in these drugs with her.\n\nAlso, she contributes nothing in terms of financial aid, \n\nwhilst eating food I buy without replacing squat.\n\nBeing loud, sneaking her crack buddies in to stay for a few nights,\n\nwithout consulting me or my roomie for that matter.\n\nSo I'd love nothing more to kick her out.\n\nOn the other hand, here in Central Alberta,\n\nWe're currently getting extreme cold warnings, as weather goes. \n\nSo it wouldn't be right to send her on her way.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of shelters for this type of situation of hers.\n\nThink I'm going to call the landlord, and get rid of her completely.\n\nIf she freezes to death, she freezes to death.

We dated for 6 months but had to breakup cause there's things in her life that makes it impossible for her to have a relationship. I still love her, and she says she does to. \nI live in a nearby city and not always go back to my hometown (where she lives), but when I do we still hangout and really enjoy our time together. \nWe were talking about getting back together and she told me she was working on it and that she would be able to be with me again soon, and it made me very happy. \nLast week I went back to my hometown to go to my friend's bday party, my plans were to smoke, drink, and have a good time with my sister and my friends. When I told her that I was going to a party she started asking me to take her with me. I tried to tell her that she would not appreciate the occasion, and that I'd like to have some time to myself, and that we could grab a beer on the next day and spend the whole day together. \nOf course she refused to accept. She said I was basically telling her that she's not good enough to hang out with me and my friends. I gave up on trying to explain to her that I just wanted to have some time to myself. \nA couple hours before the party I noticed that a few names were added to the invite list. Of course her name was there. I asked I she would really go to the party and she said that she was going with her friends (even though she only knew me and one other person in the entire party). \nWhen I got there and she saw me she started trying to kiss me but I didn't let her (multiple times). A few minutes after that she came to me holding hand with a guy and asked me if it was ok if she kissed him. \nI told her \"I am not your dad. You should do whatever you think is right\". \nSo she kissed the guy right beside me, while I was watching. \nNeedles to say that it ruined my night. After that I think she saw I was mad with her, so she kept trying to talk to me and kiss me for the next our or so, and then she left the party.\n Now she's telling me that she was not trying to hurt me, that she thought that I would not care, and that she was also hurt cause I didn't invited her to go with me.\nWas I the asshole for not inviting her? Will I be the asshole if I don't forgive her? ",

My last cheat day was on Saturday and I planned to cook chicken breast wrapped in bacon in cheese sauce for dinner (my dad used to cook it and it was my favorite dish as a kid). I bought the ingredients a couple days before and invited my girlfriend over for that night. When I went to cook it I realised that there was only 1 chicken breast left, which is only enough for 1 person, my roommate had eaten the other (he's not the asshole, we eat eachothers food sometimes and I forgot to tell him not to eat any of the food I planned to cook with). I was really looking forward to this meal so I wanted to cook it anyway and suggested my girlfriend ordered a pizza instead. She knows how much I look forward to these cheat day meals so thought she would understand. She did not. She called me an asshole for not making anything for her so I offered to cook some pasta for her, but said I would still have the chicken. She said it was too late for me to offer that and it still didn't fix the problem and left. If I didn't eat the chicken that night I wouldn't be able to have it for another few weeks so I was dead set on having it, even if she couldn't.\n\nAITA for still wanting to have the meal I planned, even if she couldn't?",

      "description": "First ever post on Reddit so sorry if I get anything wrong. Throwaway so it hopefully can't be linked back to me.  \n\n\nImportant backstory: A long time ago (several years) I got sick. It was miserable for a long time and my life never really recovered. After some time and investigation they concluded that I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. If any of you have any experience of this condition, you may know that it's not a fun diagnosis. For several years I've been stuck in a wheelchair, unable to walk distances, I've struggled to hold down a job, and I've endured comments including \"I'd kill myself if that happened to me\", \"You can cure that with cannabis/yoga/trying harder\". I've also been living in constant pain, which was written off as fibromyalgia. \n\n  \nLast week I chased up with my doctor and got a new diagnosis, Hypermobility Syndrome. It's impossible to know if I have both, or if my CFS symptoms are all explained by it. It's a massive deal because my pain is from a physical cause and I'm looking at physiotherapy that may help me it. Knowing this diagnosis I'm now able to made small changes that slightly relieve the pain, and I'm still reeling from the years I lost. Knowing it's not \"all in my head\" is a massive deal.\n\n  \nI was talking to a group of friends about this, and as soon as I said \"I have Hypermobility Syndrome\", one of them instantly declared \"I have that too\", and even worse \"We have the same thing\", talking about how \"it sometimes hurts\". I have social anxiety, so had no idea how to respond to that. In later conversation it was determined that she does not have this diagnosed, she just feels like she has it. She may do, but she lives a normal life, walking, intensive exercise. To me it doesn't feel the same at all (and it instantly shut down the conversation where I was excitedly talking about what it meant to me) , and now all our friends are left thinking that I have a minor condition, rather than the extreme disabilities I have.  \n\n\nAITA for getting upset about this? I know it was probably said with good intentions, but it felt a little like making it \"all about her\" I guess. ",

They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment.

I do love her but things are toxic at times, and sometimes she can be needy, controlling, and bossy and even i admit I can be a dick who says mean shit and just want to be left alone, it's been a long rocky road, but we've lasted sorta. \n\nAt some point I met another female who seemed to be some kind of exhibitionist, and she'd often send me random revealing pictures of her, honestly it seemed like she'd send it to anyone who ask given her social media and her never actually responding to me unless it was some generic reply...but that's besides the point... when my ex and I got back together, I cut her off, and had not spoken to her in sometime. \n\nCut to more recently and my ex and I have broken up once again, we didn't speak in a while, and I've vented my frustrations explaining how it's better when we're in person than long distance, because honestly long distance just doesn't feel the same as being with her in person when we're together things just feel right.\n\nWhat frustrates me about her is how she's always kind of a bitch to me and always giving me these shitty ultimatums and threats, honestly it makes me mad, but I love her, and while I want to leave, it kinda hurts to think about since we also have had a lot of good times and legitimate bonding moments together. \n\nBut anyway after not speaking to her for about a week and a half I re add the other female, then she starts sending me more stuff, we chat (she doesn't respond too much) , and she sends me even more. \n\nThen my ex and I start talking again, and I still get stuff from the other girl, but ultimately, I don't feel any kind of way about it as we're not together. We discuss getting back together, and even watch a movie and her visiting and what not but we never formally get back together. \n\nCut to now, she finds out about the other girl, and now she's posting pictures of herself half naked on reddit for god knows why, maybe to get me jealous, maybe for approval, maybe some kind of revenge and she's saying I \"cheated\" on her even though we weren't really together. \n\nIf I'm being honest, I feel like I was not in the wrong due to us not being together, but at the same time, I knew I couldn't come clean to her about the other female, I ultimately figured I'd just cut her off again and go about my life should my ex an I have gotten back together, but I realize even that is shady and felt kinda shitty about it.\n\nAnd now my ex isn't speaking to me, and i'm sitting here not sure how to feel about it.\n\nTL;DR: Broke up with on and off again girlfriend, got in touch with exhibitionist lady, got lewd pics, ex finds out, accuses me of cheating, starts posting half naked on reddit out of spite, and now she's not talking to me.",

      "description": "My grandparents have a college fund of approximately 10k for me, and each of my siblings. They invested a specific amount when each of us were born, and it gains interest each year until we turn 18, so we have 10k each by the time we are off to college.  I however, will be going to college in a different country which has free (or nearly free) college, so I don't need the money for the degree itself, but I would like to withdraw the money and use it over time for housing costs, visa costs, plane fees, and things of that nature. However, this particular method of college funding enforces heavy fines and taxes on the money if you withdraw it directly instead of apply it to an approved American University, so that means it would be \\~5k left to use as you want opposed to 10k directly to a college, but I am ok with that as it would still help tremendously and would be better than not using it at all. My grandparents said that unless I go to an American University, they will not give me the money to use and will instead leave it for a few years in case I change my mind and want to stay in America, and if not they will pass the money along to my siblings when they're older. \n\nAITA for feeling as though it's a bit unfair that they will not allow me to use this money? I know it is technically theirs, but the strings attached feel unfair in themselves, and I'm sure this will cause quite a bit of family drama when it comes time to decide which sibling gets to double their college fund as it cannot be divided among them.",

      "description": "I will try to be brief here, especially because I am using a different account than the one I use at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been together for 3 years now, He was somewhat conservative and I am somewhat liberal but we would always find a way to compromise on a few things, and honestly, I really liked that, I love to talk with him about politics and understand his views on certain issues. When it comes to abortion I was always (and still am) pretty pro-choice, but I always thought that I wouldn't do it, I kinda felt guilty by the idea of terminating a pregnancy, and he was pro-life of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, recently I found myself in a delicate situation, I lost my job and my family started to face some deep financial issues, issues that ended up affecting me and my income, and all of that happened right before I got pregnant. So after some deep thinking and crying, I decided that I would get an abortion since I couldn't take care of the child right now, and nor was my BF financially stable enough to take care of the baby. So I gave him the news, and he was mostly respectful about my choice, told me that he knows that in the  end it's my choice but he felt like he couldn't go on with the relationship after that, and he really felt betrayed by my choice, that last part really boggled me, I mean if he knew it was my choice then why did he felt betrayed? We ended up having a small argument over that and I ended up saying that he should accept my choice and walking away from our relationship is not the right answer, it felt like an ultimatum or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he was respectful about that, why did he felt the need to leave?  I mean I get that he doesn't approve this, but I feel like he is pressuring me somehow, and not only that, but I really don't wanna see him leaving, the situation I am in is so fucked up and letting him go would just make me feel even worse, I know that I should let him go, but it's hard to accept that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR: I Got pregnant, I wanna have an abortion, bf tells me he is gonna leave but \"respects\" my choice, but I don't wanna see him leaving.

      "description": "First of all english is not my first language. I'm sorry for any mistakes.  \nSecondly all of this happened in german. I'll translate as good as I can.   \n\n\nBackstory:  \nI started studying at the end of last year. (Info: My university is about 140 km away from my home. I study and work in a block of 3 months each.) One evening when a group of friends and me went for a drink I met this girl.  Let's call her A. That night we were the last two who were there. We were both pretty drunk. We went out to get some fresh air. She started talking about her deceased best friend and started crying. Drunk as I was, I just tried to be there for her. After about 30 minutes she decided to go home. (A friend picked her up by car)\n\nAfter that we started texting each other. Everything was relatively normal. We wanted to meet a few times but that always had to be cancelled spontaneously. (She canceled every time) On December 25th I asked her again if she could meet me. There was no answer from her until January 10th. I didn't think anything about it, because it became normal again afterwards. That went on until the beginning of February when she didn't answer again. \n\nEveryone deserves a second chance but not a third.  \n\n\nMain Part: \n\nYesterday she wrote me again. The conversation went like this:  \n\n\nA: \"Ey you?\"\n\nMe: \"Hm?\" \n\nA: \"I'm stuck in \\[My Hometown\\] because of a storm. A friend and I don't know where to go. Where do you live in \\[My Hometown\\]? So that we can stop by your house.\"\n\n*At this point I was already pissed. Not even a \"sorry\" or anything from her. She just expects me to help her. And I should say that it wasn't dangerous. The trains just didn't drive anymore.*\n\nMe: \"I live in \\[District of my hometown\\]\"\n\nA: \"Ehhh...\"\n\nMe: \"?\"\n\nA: \"Meaning?\"\n\nMe: \"You asked where I live in \\[My Hometown\\]. But funny that you just happen to write me when you need something.\"\n\n*30 minutes later*\n\nA: \"Please be pissed off then. I'll be fine. My boyfriend is on the way.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A girl that ghosted me twice needed my help because her train didn't drive home because of a storm.  When I said no she became bitchy. ",

I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? ",

He almost got into a fight with a hispanic customer after saying wetbacks should be deported and sent back to mexico or something like that. I had to intervene to stop the fight from happening. I've usually settled these incidents  by giving them free drink and told dale to stfu or I'm firing him. At this point though i've told dale to stop or i would fire him but he hasn't. Yesterday he told an old vietnamese man that he should stop blocking the doorway or he'd pour some agent orange in his next cocktail instead of politely asking him to move. The obvious solution is to just fire him because eventually an disgruntled employee or customer will film him and make it go viral giving the restaurant bad publicity  or right some really bad reviews on yelp, trip advisor or whatever. Im fed up with dale but he's a single father who has 3 children to take care of and he's taking care of his sick mother who's financially dependent on him which is why i feel i can't fire him. He's obviously a very morally  bad person but if i fire him it'll screw over the other people who depend on him. My other employees are constantly demanding i fire him but i've insisted that i can't because i don't want is kids to be screwed over. ",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have recently had a falling out and she’s decided to move back in with her parents until we can figure out where our relationship is going.\n\nI’m a trade apprentice and I’m making barely minimum wage, and my girlfriend is studying to be an engineer. I moved out of home into a cheap apartment and she decided to move in with me - she said it was to help pay my bills but I think she wanted out of her parents house as much as I did.  Rent is about 1/3 of my wage, and I pay for it all - she works casually and makes probably 1/4 what I make. She pays for groceries and that’s about it, while I pay rent, utilities, and registration and gas for my car. \n\n\nI leave for work at 7:30 and come home at 6:30 most days. When I get home I’m dead tired, sick of dealing with other people’s shit and just want to relax. She has class twice a week and goes to see her family two nights a week, so unless she’s sleeping somewhere else I see her when I leave for work and when I come home.  She cooks when she feels like it and I clean the dishes if she doesn’t make too much of a mess - she gets inspired sometimes and that makes extra dishes that I don’t feel like I should be cleaning. She also dusts, vacuums and shovels the cat litter. We do our own individual laundry, but usually she’s the one who folds them.\n\nOur recent arguments have revolved around her complaining that she is asked to do too much around the home and that the tasks are not evenly split. My opinion is that she has far more time to do more chores and that I’m the breadwinner and should be expected to do less around the home. She has responded to this by suggesting that I don’t see her as an equal - and I have to admit that I don’t. I know her studies are important but she’s currently making so little money and expects me to pay for her livelihood while she studies - wouldn’t the return for that be that she is expected to do more of the chores? Isn’t that an acceptable trade-off?\n\nI want to understand whether I’m being unreasonable, because I don’t feel like I am but our relationship is falling apart and I want to know if this is my fault.\n\n",

      "description": "My ex (24) and I (19) broke up about two months ago for a whole bunch of reasons. While we were together, he made a Hulu account and used my debit card for it, which I was perfectly fine with. After we broke up I asked him to cancel my card because I don't use Hulu often, he said he did and he never did.\n\nI let the first time after we broke up slide, but just a few days ago I picked him up from the airport and he started a whole bunch of shit on the way back and we said we would never talk to each other again. The next day I see in my bank statement that he still hasn't canceled my card, so I texted him about it and he told me that he would cancel it and pay me back.\n\nWell in that text convo we got into a small argument and he said \"find another way to get your money, I'm blocking you.\" I finally had enough of being the bigger person during the break up, so I brought my dad with me to his place to get the money, just in case anything bad happened.\n\nI told him he owed me $25 for three months of Hulu that I paid for and didn't use (we broke up like a week after he had used my card and he never gave me the password for it, so I never used it) and he kept saying how he didn't have the money. I asked when he would get it, he said he didn't know because he had just lost his job. I told him to give me something else then if he didn't have the cash.\n\nHe tried closing the door on me but I used it foot to block it and kept blocking it when he tried to close it, until he eventually poked me in the eyeballs. That only made me angry and I was able to push the door open in a fit of rage, falling down in the process. He tried to pick me up to get me off the ground and force me out, and that's when my dad got out of the car and screamed at him \"get your fucking hands off my daughter.\"\n\nI eventually left without anything, him and my dad got into a text argument and we both blocked him on everything.\n\nTldr; my ex used my debit card to pay for a Hulu account I never used and we got physical when I went to his place to get the money back.",

      "description": "This is something I think about a lot lately but the short version is that I only allow a couple people my girlfriend knows to come over and I hangout with new friends of hers at least once (usually movies or to smoke some weed, not like an interview or anything) before new ones have permission to come over. This started early into our relationship but we've been together five years now and live together. My girlfriend never brings it up and when I've asked her about it she says she doesn't mind but she's also fairly submissive due to her upbringing (this could be its own story so I'll skip it for now) and I often worry about taking advantage of her nature.  \n\n\nFor context, this is the only relationship I've ever done this in. When it first started it was because my girlfriend has friends who imo could be problematic to have around and I have a home business. The gallery includes an alcoholic who up until a few months ago would pee randomly at parties, two guys I /know/ are engaging in non-violent/non-theft felonious activities (I don't want to go into details here but this isn't just a hunch, from her stories I recognize the activity the pair are engaging in), a guy who got out of the navy (not a problem) and spends most of his time saying obscene things to women because he never reintegrated into regular life (the problem), and another guy who screamed at her while she was weezing on the ground from a panic attack once. There's also two girls who are newer and sort've obnoxious but seem alright truthfully. I've been thinking of saying it'd be alright if the pair of girls came over but all of these people are part of the same circle and I'm worried about them inviting the rest of the gang (their friend circle is very \"if x is here then the whole gang should be here\")  \n\n\nI realize this probably sounds like I'm only focusing on the negatives but what I've described is the whole group of friends minus a few that don't come around anymore these days (classmates from when she was taking classes and a girl from a hobby group) . Despite what I've described, my girlfriend has never complained about the situation and I'm very happy with her despite however strange this probably sounds.",

      "description": "My college is a school of resource management and environmental science. There's one dude in my section everyone hates because he's a moron and thinks he's better than everyone else (talks about how he already knows everything cause he already took the course even though he's still in it cause he failed). In common first semester everyone has to pass a compassing exercise to find their way to a specific point in the woods. This guy Sean found another moron to be his partner his name... Shawn. The bus ride there every time he opens his bag we can smell weed he tries to deny having it and we're all like dude we don't care. As soon as he gets off the bus he pulls out a shatter pen and they start hitting it pretending their trying to hide it but showing everyone cause the think there cool. An hour later me and my partner are in the woods and haven't seen another group in over 30 minutes Sean comes up asking if we've seen Shawn because he can't find him and he DOESNT HAVE A COMPASS and my partner goes something tells me you were 30 meters from him at one point (We use tools called. Chains to navigate which space us 30 meters apart from our partners). To which Sean replies ok I'm gonna go keep looking for him can you help me and Me and my partner not wanting to ruin are mark said no. But also In my head I have these images of him getting lost too trying to find him and everyone having to go find them both so I told him to continue to his point and let the professor there know. Half an our later we get to our point and the profs are just learning of this to head out and find him. Turns out he fell over in the snow which was past my knees and I'm 5'11\" and was so high decided that meant he had to lie there. When they found him he was burying himself. I keep thinking I should've helped find the dude he could've been super hurt or lost for a long time in the deep snow but instead I told the only person looking for him to abandon him. Am I an asshole.",

      "description": "         I had been dating a girl for a little over 2 months and things seemed to be going smoothly. One week I started to notice something off with how my friend was acting in a group chat with my girlfriend. He would send heart eye emojis and she would return them when saying goodnight and stuff like that. She seemed to give him far more attention than me and he seemed interested in her. \n       I dm'd her after about 3 days of this saying that I thought he liked her (after consulting 2 of my friends about this to make sure I wasn't crazy). She said that it doesn't matter if he does like her because he can't control it, but I thought this was BS as he can control how he acts though.\n       At school I was visibly mad at him, and they started texting about me when I had his phone and was playing a game on it, she texted him. I suspected they were talking about me, because he was hiding his phone from me the whole period. I was nosy and clicked into a notification from her that said something along the lines of \"don't text me right now he's mad at me\". \n      She said that I was mad at him for no reason and that it was uncalled for. I made a few jokes poking fun at it, and a few days later she dumped me. The reason she gave me up front was that she \"wasn't mentally ready\" for a relationship. I was later able to find out her reason for dumping me was that I was \"too overprotective\" and that I reacted poorly to the situation. \n     I found out later that he sent her heart Emojis over dm's and that they face timed very frequently. I am also almost 90% sure they were on FaceTime when she texted me to dump me as well.\n       For that whole week I ignored the both of them as I thought I had a good reason. I was also able to find a few days later that my friend actually did like my girlfriend, and that I wasn't spreading \"lies\" as my friend said I was. I also saw a screenshot that said that my ex had feelings for my friend (keep in mind this is a few days after the breakup). They both didn't know that I know this and they continue to feed me lies about how he had nothing to do with our breakup, however she clearly lost feelings for me and quickly gained them for him\n     In a group chat my friend made a remark that \"suicide jokes weren't funny\" so during class I said that I was going to kill myself in an obvious sarcastic manner (I know that suicide is a serious topic, and I regret these jokes, however I was seriously pissed off). \n     My friend never apologized for lying to my face and also basically flirting with my ex over dm's but he wanted me to apologise for the suicide jokes to him. \n    We have since sort of made up but I am just wondering, am I the asshole for getting mad at him. I know it was uncalled for to click  into their private messages, but was it that bad of an offense? Was I overprotective? Did I go too far? I never specifically told her to stop talking to him I just told her that she gave him much more attention. In summary was I the asshole for generally being mad at him\n",

      "description": "Okay let’s get a few points out of the way before start the story.\nI’m transgender (female to male) and gay. I came out about four to five years ago. Okay so let’s start.\nI have a friend who I’ll call Meg. Meg and I have been best friends for about six, almost seven years now. She’s spent countless weekends at my house and sometimes has spent even a whole week at my house. We talk all the time and have never really had an actual fight other than who cares about the other more.\nAbout five months ago I told my mom that I was tired of having Meg’s family always call me by my birth name but I was scared to come out because they are an extremely Christian family and Meg had told me they don’t accept it. \nAfter talking for a bit we decided that my mom would text Meg’s mom and basically come out for me. \nOnce Meg’s mom found out I was transgender she then banned us from having sleepovers. Meg and I were both devastated because we’ve spent almost a decade spending nights together and laughing over stupid stuff. \nNow my mom being the lady she is decided to try and make it so things wouldn’t be like this. Meg is basically like family to me AND my family now. My mom calls her daughter and my sisters call her their sister. \nThe reason Meg’s mom wouldn’t let us have sleepovers anymore was because she said I’m a boy and she needs to “protect her kids.” That was the part that hit me the hardest. That my best friend now needed to be protected from me in the woman’s eyes. My mother went on to tell her “but [name redacted]! He’s gay!” But that still didn’t change her mind.\nI don’t know what to do. Meg and I are both devastated that we can’t have sleepovers anymore and it isn’t just that. Almost every time we ask if Meg can come over her mother says she can’t because they’re “busy” even when Meg tells me that all she is doing that day is laying in bed. \nSo what do you think? Am I the asshole for being upset with how this is all playing out?",

      "description": "I will admit that I am already an asshole. I moved with my boyfriend to another state and cheated on him physically and emotionally within the first year of the move with someone back home. There was a lot going on, but instead of playing the blame game, I just admit that what I did was wrong, deceitful, heartless, and disgusting...and I’m an asshole for that.\n\nWe went to an expensive couples counseling for months, but what it really came down to was that he never really forgave me and I could never forgive myself. I feel this sickening guilt, the kind that makes you feel nauseous and panicky, because I know I broke him. I broke his heart, his mind, and his soul. \n\nNow that we’ve come down to it, I am moving out by myself, in a state where I know no one. I have no family or friends to lean on. The only people I spoke to outside of work were my (ex)boyfriend and his uncles. And rightfully, I’ve lost that. \n\nMy (ex) boyfriend makes twice as much income as me, however I had a big savings. We moved with the deal that I would pay what I could for rent and I’d put half down for the car. I paid a $4,000 down payment for the car and he is paying the other $4,000 monthly. I paid more than a quarter of the rent, half car insurance, half internet monthly. All groceries, gas, furniture, repairs on the car, counseling were split evenly. I would ask monthly, if I should be paying more on rent, but he never said I should. The money I was not using to pay more rent helped me afford our trips together, while still being able to pay what was agreed on for rent, as I don’t get paid-time-off at work.\n\nNow that we split, he says the car is in his name, it’s his car. Fine. What about the $4000 down payment? He said I’ve saved over $3000 by paying so little rent because I lived with him, implying I shouldn’t get that money back. That was not the agreement. I did not agree to backlogging rent that was never agreed that I was to pay in the first place. I’m not expecting $4000, but I think in fairness, I should get $2000-3000 back. \n\nMaybe I don’t deserve it back, maybe it’s karma, maybe it’s what I owe for causing emotional damage.\n\nI’m an asshole for cheating. But AITA for wanting my money back?",

First time posting here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile talking about my job prospects, because it's currently not going so well right now, I said to my SO of almost 2 years that while I appreciate her advice, it's different because she's not in the same field, Computer Science. She is Math and Econ and works with pricing at a large company. I live with housemates that will be interning at Amazon, Google, Capital One, and Goldman Sachs and we often talk about the hiring process and the technical interviews. She said she is hurt because I said that I value my housemate's advice more than hers. But I explained that it's different because when she gives me **general** advice I value her input greatly, comparably to my mother's advice. However, this, specifically, is something that she might not have as much experience in, which I do not blame her for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, her feelings were hurt, so clearly what I said wasn't okay. I apologized immediately and told her I will try to structure my words better so that this doesn't happen in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened yesterday and she is still upset about it and does not want to continue our regular conversations through text, because I am at work during the weekdays and visit her during the weekends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love some input on what I might have did wrong or is there something that I am not seeing? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My sister and I were always quite close - (talked on the phone almost every day, texted), up until 3 years ago when I moved about 1,000 miles away (a 2 hour flight about $50 where we are). I was really nervous to move, but my sister was really supportive and promised she'd come and visit within the weeks of me moving. It didn't feel like a big deal, because we travel to other countries all the time (in Europe) and I come and spend a month in my home country every year (2 x 2 week trips at Christmas and in Summer). I'm 27 and she's 26. It was always just us and my mum after our parents separated, and as we are quite estranged from other family on both sides, I thought we would stay friends and that we were quite a close family unit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround the same time, she moved in with a new boyfriend and I understood that she was busy with that, and we weren't in touch so much anymore. She deleted her Facebook and all other forms of social media, making it hard to keep in touch. She started picking up the phone less, never calling me, and chatting for about 3 minutes and saying she was really busy and had to go everytime we did get the chance to talk. The promise to come and visit within the first year quickly fell through despite every month she was promising to come and visit the next one, as she ended up going on a vacation elsewhere with her partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about a year, she said she'd come and visit for my 26th birthday. I was really excited, told all of my new friends in my new town about her, planned what we'd do... and it started getting suspiciously near without hearing plane details (it's hard to keep in touch, since she doesn't use any social media or messaging apps). I called to follow up on the week she promised she was coming and she said she had actually gone on a Mediterranean trip with her partner instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next year, promises to come were all full again, but I brought it up each time. Each time she'd say I'm being silly and of course she's coming soon, about to book the tickets again etc. Then it turns out her boyfriend's friend is getting married in the US.. again she's decided to go on a trip 6,000 miles away and spend a few weeks across the ocean. I told her I hope she has fun, listened to all the details when we were both visiting my mother and my other (much younger) sister and 'stepfather' on the same day, etc. but did tell her on several occasions how disappointing this is getting when she promised to visit me first and has been on several foreign trips arranged well after the first promise to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe come to this year, and she texted me a few weeks ago saying she'll book a ticket to come as soon as she gets her salary in January, I offered to pay and just told her I'm really excited to show here where I live and what my life is like now so I called her today as it's been a couple of weeks since then and she says she's going on a trip to New York in Spring and as soon as she's done with that, she'll book a ticket to come and visit me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her, at this point, I'm really sick and tired of planning a trip which never happens. Hearing that once again she's booked a new trip to New York (on another continent), instead of spending 2 hours on a plane and $50 - $100 to come and see me first for a few days since she's been promising for the 4th year (happened several times in 2016, 2017, 2018 and now 2019) then I want to leave the idea altogether. I told her I'd never bring it up again, that it's given me sleepless nights, and I would appreciate for her to not bring it up again. I told her I can accept the fact that we have grown up and are no longer close, and that it's easier for me to tell people when they ask that I have a sister but we're not at all close. It hurts me when coworkers and friends ask me and tell me it's so strange that nobody has come to see me. I always say I Have a sister who is coming soon, but I've been saying that to the same people for the 4th year now and it's starting to get really embarrassing. I'd rather just say I have a sister but we're not really in touch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been texting me now saying that she doesn't know why I'm acting weird, she promises she is 100% coming and that I'm acting 'weird' by just telling her to forget it. It's so much easier for me to stop pretending we're still anything like we used to be, because I miss her and I'm honestly quite lonely not having had the chance to show her my new life. I'd rather forget the idea altogether We still get along well when I go and meet her for dinner when I'm in my hometown again, so I considered the idea that her partner is banning her from communicating or that he needs to be the number 1 priority at all times, but I asked her privately a few times and she was offended by the idea. It seems she just really loves him and being a part of his world and visiting his family and friends is just much, much more important to her than her family. Which is fine, but I just wish she'd admit it so I can move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I have a really weird kind of friendship with someone where at times we are inseparable and sometimes we would go months without seeing the other person. She is really really active on Instagram and whenever she posts a stort with a choice between lets say 'Yes' or 'No' I usually say No (basically picking the negative choice). Today she posted a story with her boyfriend and said 'Relationship goals?' with the choices being 'Yaassssss' and 'Eh' and since I knew she would want 100:0 I thought I won't answer this but when I saw her story again I absent mindedly picked the 'Eh' option and the ratio went from 100:0 to 88:12. She saw this and messaged me saying I'm blocked from watching her stories and I'm an asshole. Am I?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my principal that my teachers aide is probably having a mental breakdown?",
      "description": "I have a male teacher’s aide who has a small desk in my room (because of lack of space to be stationed anywhere else.) He’s actually in my room maybe a quarter of the day and off doing duties and working with other kids the rest.  He is about 25.\n\nWe have worked together for three and a half years now. He moved away halfway through to try to work for a game company (his dream) but it didn’t pan out. He returned a year ago and was able to get his job back. He hasn’t been the same since then. He used to be a very Zen guy but now he is troubled and loses his temper easily with kids.  I also lose my temper with my kids but I’m a tiny woman, the effect is kind of like a squawking chicken. He’s scary. Plus I lose my temper because I’m trying to wrangle 28 of them for 7 hours a day. He works with small groups of 5-10 at a time and very occasionally with a whole class but for 20-45 minutes at a time. He gets frequent breaks and transitions between his duties, which for me would be ideal for my own stress level. But he has OCD and I think when things aren’t exactly like he wants them to be, he loses it.\n\nYesterday morning during reading groups he lost it at one of my boys. The boy got up to go to the bathroom while TA was giving instructions for the assignment. Side note: I’m that rare teacher who lets my 5th graders get up and go to the bathroom when they want without asking. It’s a human right to use the bathroom. If I notice a child leaving frequently and I suspect it’s to get out of working, I counsel them privately. (Sometimes it is that, most of the time I find out abuela made dinner way too spicy and they have diarrhea 😅)\n\nAnyway, just the way he raised his voice and chastised the boy to come back was scary to me. It unsettled the group of kids I was working with, they looked uncomfortable. I felt upset because the boy in question is a very good child. I tried to brush it off, but he snapped twice more at other children for fiddling with their pencils. \n\nMy kids went to an assembly right after and I sought out the principal. I told her my concerns and she said other teachers had said similar things but it was pretty scattered. I’m the only teacher who sees him so consistently. She had me write it up and then she talked to him, and told him to go home for the rest of the day.\n\nHe tearfully came up to me during lunch and asked if I had told. I admitted I had and he said he understood, but he looked so resigned and miserable. He texted me later that he didn’t think he was fit to teach. I responded that he was just in a low place mentally and needed to try to get that sorted out. I understand because I suffered from bad post partum depression two years ago. I cried in the classroom almost every day, and ended up spending Christmas break in a mental health unit to get stabilized because I was suicidal. I had told my principal (a former one) that I was struggling badly but he just brushed me aside. This is why I wanted to step it up and get the boss involved. I WISH a coworker had said “she’s losing it” and I was encouraged to take some time off. \n\nBut I can’t help thinking that what I did was somewhat assholeish. Should I have talked to him first? I’ve been talking to him and trying to give him advice for months. And part of my motivation, honestly was that I’m tired of him wasting all my planning time (the snatches of time I have while the kids are out at recess or at specials) wanting to talk and vent to me about his problems. I need that time to get prepared for lessons because I try to avoid taking work home with me. Between working a tutoring job and a commute, I get about two good hours with my son on weekdays and then two hours to myself at home. I don’t want to spend that time lesson planning. But I have been because I can’t work with him talking to me. So partially I was fed up with that, and part of me was genuinely concerned for him unselfishly.\n\nAITA?",

She’s so chatty and energetic when talking to all my friends but when she talks to me it’s so much quieter and like she doesn’t even wanna be there. Recently we were walking around and she was basically silent and hardly engaging in my conversation and then the moment we ran into a friend she perked up and began initiating conversation and seemed a lot happier. When I asked her about this she got mad at me saying that it’s “comfortable silence” and that I shouldn’t even care how she acts around other dudes coz we’re dating. \n\nIs it wrong to be upset at her over this kind of stuff?",

I ended up getting a kitten for him to play with, and they get along great. :) The other day, I got a random text from TW, asking me if she could have the cat *back* because apparently, her seven year old son couldn’t accept that he’d “run away” as she’d told him, and was inconsolable about it. She claimed he was still leaving cat food out and calling the cats name in the backyard at night, and just really laid it on thick. I haven’t responded yet.

      "description": "Okay, this is my first time ever posting to reddit actually so please be understanding, thx &lt;3\n\nSo, I have this friend, let's just call her Stephanie who has a boyfriend named Raoul (yes, the names are fake). Through a weird turn of events I end up dating Raoul's sister, Eve.\n\nRaoul has a serious gambling addiction. No joke with the word addiction, guy lost 200$ on a single soccer ticket. He can fuel his addiction because of his parents who are a rather wealthy bunch. Stephanie has had many arguments with Raoul about this problem of his but they worked it out everytime. Raoul apologized and promised he would never do it again, and Stephanie believed him for some reason.\n\nOne day, dude loses all of his money at slots or whatever and his sister has to loan him some money. Eve does exactly so and lends him some money and after some more fighting with Raoul everything seems fine. However, Eve tells me a few days later that he actually went and gambled all of the money he got from her as well and she had to lend him more BUT THEY NEVER TOLD STEPHANIE. They didn't tell her because they were both sure at this point that she was gonna' break up with him for this one, it was already too much.\n\nObviously I wanted to tell Stephanie the moment i found out but I was held back by two things, one, it really wasnt my place to invade their relationship and two, Eve would've probably broken up with me as well if i would've told her.\n\nFast forward two months after this, I've been broken up with Eve for a while now out of a completely different reason, and I remember this thing. I go and tell Stephanie everything about what happened.\n\nTL;DR I ratted out this dude my friend was dating that was keeping the fact that he gambled again hidden right after having an argument about his gambling addiction with her.\n\nMy questions are ... Was I an asshole for getting involved? Was I an asshole for keeping this hidden from Stephanie because Eve would've broken up with me if i told her? Should I have kept my mouth shut or should I have told her sooner? Just any kind of opinions and judgement would be much appreciated, I'm really curious about other people's opinions considering how I've already done it and there's no changing what I did anymore.",

      "description": "I was a supervisor for some years at a local manufacturing plant with a strict policy on attendance. This happened within days of me getting my promotion.\n\nI took over a department that had been without supervision for a while and as such was in pretty bad shape. The employees were basically running wild because they had been able to do whatever they wanted for the better half of a year, including missing as many days as they wanted with no repercussions. This is what I walked into. I immediately started doing warnings for attendance and other issues to try and get the department in line. One employee (I'll call him K) I wrote up when I first started had missed several more days than were allowed according to policy, and the only reason I didn't fire K was because no one had written him up about his excessive absences. In my write up, I explained that if K was late, or missed any more days his employment would be terminated. Two days later, K came in 2 hours late. I brought him to HR and terminated his employment as I had promised. As I was walking K out he told me that it was pretty messed up that I had fired him the day he found out he had cancer, that i had basically killed him by taking away the health insurance needed to fight it. I had some discretion to cut him some slack, but didn't, even though I felt bad. So, AITA?",

      "description": "I started an internship a few months ago. Myself (female) and another intern (male) clicked super fast as friends. We’re both new to the city. He’s always seemed very relaxed at work, but at the same time pretty private. A guy he has always called his friend has picked him up from work a few times and stopped by after work drinks to hang out, but they’ve always left quickly. Anyways, my coworker and I have gotten closer over the last few months. One drunk night a few weeks ago he told me he had questioned his sexuality a lot. So the next time I saw him with his “friend”, I asked him later if they were dating and he said yes. I was super happy for him, no big deal. He said he was relieved because he never knows how people will react and he doesn’t want to get too close to people before they know. Things have been smooth sailing since then.\n\nSo his boyfriend facebook-added me a week or so ago, and I did a little creeping the other day. I see that they’ve been posting couple pictures together for almost three years — I was a bit taken aback because I just thought they had just met and were casually dating. I don’t care so much, but I guess I feel hurt that I thought I was getting closer to him as a friend and he never thought to mention that they were in a very serious relationship, which just seems like something you tell your friends. I feel like I can’t really trust him now and sort of like I don’t know who he is if that makes sense? I asked our third close friend if she had known they had been dating that long and she said she didn’t even know they were dating at all, period (but that she been suspicious that they were). So I guess he’s just a pretty private person towards everyone, which made me feel a little better. and I know his personal life isn’t my business but I still feel hurt.\n\nI texted today and jokingly said “Dude!! [third friend] and I had no idea you and [boyfriend] were so serious hahaha” and he just said “well it’s all over my social media haha, I just don’t like telling people out of nowhere”. I just that it was a good thing, that he and his boyfriend looked very happy but that I was just shocked. He didn’t respond but normally he would be very easygoing. I’m just wondering AITA and how should I proceed from here if I am, please knock some sense into me. I’m pretty sure I could’ve handled the situation a lot better but I’d like to know how specifically.",

It's important to know that I'm really transparent and blunt, bordering on just mean, I suppose.\n\nRon the kind of guy who constantly insists that everyone loves him and that he's everyone's favorite person. I got a portrait tattoo and wouldn't stop telling me that it didn't look like him and I was supposed to get his face cuz he's my favorite. Obviously a joke, but more irritating than funny. \n\nIf you mention that you don't like a song, he'll pull it up on Spotify and sing to it until you leave. \n\nHe posted on Facebook that if you are more than 4 years younger than him there is an \"intelligence gap\" and he \"doesn't care what you have to say\". He tried to talk to me the next day and I told him that since I was more than 4 years younger than him, he shouldn't talk to me because of said intelligence gap. He told me I shouldn't take the things he says seriously.\n\nOnce he asked me if I thought he was datable. I told him to give me his ex girlfriend's phone numbers and I'd figure it out. He said that he's never been in a relationship longer than a couple months and that he's more of a \"side guy who gets the job done when your man can't.\" And I basically called him a fuckboy. I see him flirting with our underage cashiers frequently also.\n\nWeeks later he asked me what I thought of him in front of another associate. I told him that he was kind of annoying. I think that was the first time I hurt his feelings a bit. \n\nToday he was talking to a couple other co-workers and I heard him insists that I love him again or something and I told him the more he says that, the more I dislike him. He told me that he didn't care what I thought and that's just part of his personality. One of my male coworkers said \"pushing yourself on people isn't a personality\". Ron replied with \"saying it like that makes me sound creepy, I'm not creepy\".\n\nThat's where I said that he is indeed, creepy. He asked how and I told him \"You seem like the guy who would stalk a girl until she got mad and told you to leave them alone\". He seemed hurt and surprised by that and quickly left to go on lunch. After Ron left, the girl that he is training on sales for a day or two told me that he is really pushy.\n\nI do feel really bad and I'm planning on apologizing for hurting his feelings, but I am not taking it back because that's how I truly feel. Am I the asshole for what I said?",

However, this lady, we'll call her M (she's a part of the other family), always shows up an 1-2 hours before the start time. I wouldn't have such a problem with this if all she wanted to do was hang out in the living room, but M spends her time standing around in the kitchen and \"helping\".

That way, she'll get the message that she's not welcome before the party actually starts. \n\nMy mom (the only person that I've proposed to his plan to) thinks that I'm an asshole because M it's an old lady and it would be cruel to leave her out in the New York cold. \n\nTL;DR: I want to ignore an old lady when she comes to the door long before the party starts so that she gets the message that she's not welcome that early.",

      "description": "Now I want to start this off by saying that my lawn wraps around the side of my house. Our entire property is about 3/4 of an acre placed on an otherwise normal suburban street. The lawn goes all the way back and all the way around the back to the other side of the house, and the driveway is touching the entire lawn as well as my neighbor's house.\n\nSo this morning I had my alarms set for 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45 a.m. The first two go off, I'm five minutes back to sleep before my next alarm when I hear the doorbell ring. Then I went to look at my doorbell camera and this guy is standing there, doing nothing. Two minutes later he rings again, twice this time. Again we did nothing and he did nothing, this guy seems sketchy the way he apparently needs to talk to us. So he realizes we're not there or just not gonna come answer. So on the camera I watch him walk down the sidewalk about half way towards my driveway, stop, and then look down my lawn like he's trying to see what's behind my house. Then he walks down to my driveway where the view of the camera ends. So I get up to look out the window and lo and behold he walked halfway down my driveway, backed up into my lawn and started taking pictures of the neighbor's house. My mother is afraid of this man and whatever his intentions are.\n\nSo here I lost my cool. I banged on the window and started yelling at him, telling him \"get the fuck off my lawn\" and \"who the fuck are you?\" He thought my gestures telling him to get off the lawn meant, \"come back to the door and let's talk about this.\" I had to leave for school and I'm not usually very confrontational but I had no choice except to confront him.\n\nI opened the door and the first thing he did was reach out to shake my hand. I guess he knew I was too polite to refuse that. So I shook his hand and I said, \"who the hell are you? You ring my doorbell three times, no one answers so you go down my driveway and start taking pictures of the neighbor's house?\" Still a snarky tone because A. I'm confused as hell, and B. I'm just waking up. He explains everything. He says he's power washing the neighbor's house (I can see his company truck parked in front of their house) and he was simply coming to tell me that my car in the driveway would most likely get misted. Now that I think of it, he made no mention to whether or not he was going to tell me that he'd be on my property at any point. Anyway, my mood is easily manipulated by kindness. I immediately apologized and felt like a huge ass hole. He kept explaining til I got to my car and then I told him that he has a job to do so whatever is necessary just do it.\n\nI don't think he had I'll intentions but I still think he handled it wrong. I think I handled it wrong too. What is my fate? AITA?",

      "description": "So I’m 17 and yesterday it was time for me to go get depo shot (every three months). I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I’m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn’t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn’t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I’m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do ‘research on it’ and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she’s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I’m not too sure why she’s going so hard about it. What would’ve been the difference between now and 18? I’m not sure why she thinks I’m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I’m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hey all,\n\nSo this is pretty short. It was snowing when I got home last night, and I realized my neighbor’s windshield wipers were down. My neighbor and I share a driveway, so we park right to each other. I put mine up to keep them from freezing to the glass, and then I did the same to his Corolla to do him a solid. He texted me this morning pretty upset, basically told me not to touch his shit again. Fair enough. \n\nI mean we’ve always gotten along pretty well. I wouldn’t necessarily say we’re *friends*, but we get along. Brief chit chat if we see each other in the driveway. He invited to his place when they threw a party for his girlfriend getting her green card. He does kickboxing in his basement, and we’ve trained in his basement a couple times. We don’t talk about much, but get along well enough. That’s why I figured he’d appreciate me doing that for him. No one likes their wipers frozen to the glass. \n\nMy first thought was you don’t want someone to miss with your shit in case they fuck something up, but he knows I’m a gear head. I mean hell I even put a new alternator into his Corolla for him because a mechanic wanted over $300 just to put the sob in. \n\nI dunno. Yeah, in retrospect, texting him asking if he wanted me to put his wipers up would’ve been easy. It really just never crossed my mind ",

We were both extremely drunk at this stage so honestly my memory of how it even started is hazy. It was absolutely just a one-off drunken thing and after a few days of awkwardness things went back to normal and it didn't have any lasting impact on our friendship. We both decided that given Sarah's suspicions and feeling of being left out that it would be best not to tell her about our little mistake, especially since it was just a one-off thing.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and while Sarah and I are talking the subject of  mine and Jade's relationship comes up. Sarah makes a comment hinting at me and Jade having slept together. Given she had showed no signs of knowing and hadn't said anything about it previously we had assumed she hadn't heard anything so I told her that Jade and I were just friends and nothing sexual had happened between us. Sarah said she doesn't believe me, and I continued to deny it. Eventually she tells me that she heard us getting it on and knows that we have in fact had sex.\n\nSo now Sarah is mad at me for lying to her. I understand that lying to her face like that was wrong, but I honestly felt that it was best for everyone involved to keep her in the dark about it, and couldn't see any benefit in her knowing. I've explained this to her but she's still angry at me for lying. \n\nSo, AITA here?",

      "description": "Been having an issue with neighbors (2 of them) who let their cats roam.  Been an on going issue for a couple of years.  I have raised the issue in the past with the HOA (who has given warnings) and local animal control (also given warnings).\n\nOn Saturday, neighbor 1 (who is the most egregious offender) posted to a local FB group that their cat is missing.  I looked in my home security camera events (which is constantly catching the cat walking past my door), and last event was from Thursday afternoon.  It snowed overnight Thursday (about an inch on the ground, still some left).  In the FB post comments, neighbor 1 says cat was last seen Thursday afternoon.   They said they have checked other shelters with no luck.  My fear is the cat, left out overnight, died.  \n\nTonight, Sunday, I am driving home and I see a cat outside.  It's dark, so I go to look.  Take a few pictures of it roaming around.  It is neighbor's 2 cat.  It is 9:30pm, very little light, and currently 30 degrees F.\n\nI called the police non-emergency, and sat in my car for around an hour waiting for the officer to show up.  I showed the officer pictures of the cat outside my house, explained the story of the other missing cat, and pointed out that the owner's garage door is still currently partially open (enough to allow the cat to get back in when it wants to return home).  \n\nMy issue with this is strictly the well-being of the cats.  It is dark outside, there's cars and other predators, and it is cold enough for snow to be on the ground still.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?

I was so anxious for days and I sat her down in a bar and explained I cannot support her in my country with a kid, it will be a challenge as it is. I have an internship and my freelance work barely let's me afford anything, and I live with my parents. I said I can send money to her and visit but I physically have no way to support her and a kid in my country but I wouldn't abandon her. I explained my travel surprise and bought her a nice dinner to cheer her up, she explained to her family that I am in no position and watching me so worried and anxious made her choose.  \n\nI feel awful for telling her she can't have it, she was so happy for one and I feel I am dashing her dreams. I said to her I can support one when I have a stable job etc. but now my parents don't like her and I want them to meet her as my girlfriend before even considering kids.  \n\nTL;DR I explained to my girlfriend I cannot support a child now and would have to send her money to her home country until I' stable.

      "description": "I've been super great friends with Beryl for ages. 6 years? Maybe longer. \nShe's a Christian who is quite progressive in her beliefs but traditional and fundamentalist in other aspects. It's kinda hard to explain.  \nShe's all for SSM and abortion, but no kissing before marriage and careful with your clothing. Not sure if that's relevant.  \n  \nLately Beryl has, become somewhat of a SJW - but still definitely a Christian - and her church has become gradually more conservative and fundamental. This has happened over the last year or so.  \n  \nIt is now at the point where Beryl and the church's views conflict so much so that the only things they seem to agree on is the very basics of Christianity.  \nAnd yet Beryl still goes there. Every Wednesday and Sunday nights she phones me in a bad mood, depressed, and almost in/actually in tears. She tells me everything that happened and we usually talk for close to an hour.  \nHer other friends and I have tried to convince her to leave that church and find somewhere else. We've been tellinh her this for what feels like years now. It's exhausting. We know there aren't any romantic interests keeping her there. We've asked countless times.  \n  \nHere's where the AITA comes in. I ghosted Beryl. I couldn't do it any more and just gave up on our friendship over a disagreement on where she goes to church.  \n  \nTL;DR AITA for ghosting my best friend over something seemingly as petty as a shitty church?",

      "description": "A couple months ago, I’d begun losing contact with my closest online friends since the friendships were just stagnating. Eventually, I met someone new online and began relying on him almost entirely emotionally since I was going through a rough patch. Eventually, he revealed he had a crush on me, and I told him that I didn’t really reciprocate and that it was fine and we could still be friends. Eventually, he began distancing himself from me saying he didn’t wanna get too attached, and I felt really bad because I felt the one person I trusted the most was drifting a way. So, I placated him for a while and told him that he still had a chance. Eventually, he wanted a clear answer on if we were gonna date and in the spur of the moment I said yes. I hoped that eventually my feelings would change and I would enjoy being in the relationship. Last night, after about a month of dating, I realized my feelings hadn’t changed. I told him that I wanted to break up and told him why. Obviously, he was incredibly upset himself as I was a huge emotional crutch for him and he suddenly felt like our whole friendship was a lie. During the dispute, he mentioned that he had begun to distance himself as a tactic to get me to date him. I argued that I was trapped because of his actions but he said if I’d just said no I could’ve spared him the heartbreak. On one hand, I led him on for a month making him think our romantic relationship was genuine when I just wanted platonic one, but on the other hand I was manipulated into a spot where I felt I had no choice but to say yes or lose my best friend.

I found out about the concert at the beginning of January and when I told my girlfriend about it she said we could definitely go. It’s a small venue where rappers go when they are getting big but still haven’t blown up yet. A small enough venue where you stand maybe anywhere from next to the stage to only like 50 feet away. The general admission tickets were only $20. We had agreed to purchase the tickets together but every time I asked her if she was ready to buy the tickets or if she had the money she would put it off. Every single time. Tonight I finally had enough of it so I went to buy them myself and found the show had sold out. After a long discussion with my girlfriend of letting her know how disappointed I was and how “sorry isn’t good enough this time” she found resale tickets online for $180 in total and purchased them saying I didn’t have to pay her back. I agreed and don’t plan on giving her any money for them. Am I the asshole Reddit?",

I want to hold her responsible. At the same time, what if she really doesn’t remember? Is it fair for me to hold things against her that she doesn’t remember? Am I just being vengeful?

      "description": "So basically I had been seeing this girl (let’s call her F)  for a couple of months and honestly I never had strong feelings for her but she was nice we got along and I wanted to give her a chance to see if things could work. \nAt the start of December I met this other girl (let’s call her S) through a mutual friend and we quickly became friends and I started to develop feelings for her. \nNow I live only 10-15 minutes walk away from S. (Is relevant for later). I realized that I basically had far stronger feelings for S then I did for F. This was around the 20th of December. With it being so close to Christmas and the new year I put off breaking up with F until after the holidays. \n I only saw F maybe once a week and was trying to get myself ready to break up and was building a distance to make it a little less shocking and maybe easier on myself. Honestly I’m not good at break ups, so I’m sure I’ve done something wrong there. \nNow around early-mid January I had only seen F once and hadn’t managed to break up because like I said I’m not good at it and just didn’t manage it. This was my mistake I know. \nThen my mom got sick. There was a couple of weeks where I wasn’t sure that my mom wouldn’t make it. Also I live a 20 hour flight away from my parents and going to see them would not be cheap or easy. So basically there was no point in me going back when it wouldn’t help. I felt pretty awful about this and said as much to F who was super nice and understanding. But having already decided to break up with her I didn’t want to lean on her to much during this because she was also busy with work and such. However we didn’t really see each other much over these few weeks so again we didn’t break up. 1) because I just didn’t feel up to it and 2) because I felt she deserved to see me in person rather then doing it over the phone.\n\nThen There is S. We had become fast friends and I had feelings for her. Basically she was free a lot while I was worried about my mom and because we lived so close we ended up spending a lot of our time together just hanging out. Nothing romantic about it just as friends because she lived so close and I wasn’t enjoying being alone with my thoughts. However honestly I did fall for S even harder during this time period.\nAbout a week after I knew my mom was gonna be fine I found a chance to agree to meet F on a day she was free and planned to break up with her then. \n\nThe night before I was up late talking to S and telling her what I had planned for the next day. Shortly after she told me she had feelings for me I told her the same and after talking for a bit we agreed that we both wanted to give it a chance so agreed that next weekend we would meet and try going on a date. \nOverall I feel bad for agreeing that date the night before breaking up with F but does that make me an asshole? \nFor the record I was kind to F and we are still occasionally talking as friends it ended on decent terms but I have had several friends act like they really disapprove. Am I the asshole? \n",

After a second I manage to stop myself and apologize for my inappropriate outburst.\n\nThey boot me and ban me from the server.  I tried to apologize to my friend but he told me I was an asshole and embarrassed him in front of the group.  He hasn't responded to me in a few days and I feel really terrible for it.

I truly love my GF and I hate that I have put her in that kind of situation.   \nSo as of today I tried to make an appointment at the bank to set up an account for my daughter where all money like child support go on to. In order to do that Kim has to go to the bank with me. I reached out to her to make an appointment but she canceled via text message because her grandmother has passed away.   \nFrom here on everything went downwards. I expressed my sincere condolences and told her that I will rearrange the whole thing. As usual Jess gets screenshots of this whole scenario.   \nI didn't expect a response to that at all but Jess suddenly lost her composure. She told me that it pisses her off that I expressed my \"sincere\" condolences and not only \"my condolonces\". From there on it all spiraled down. She told my to not be so gentle towards her and that she wishes us good luck with our little family. There are much more things she said but honestly I am not in the mood to write it all down. Of all things that were said, the thing with the condolences annoys me the most because it makes me wonder if she is that emotionally cold and angry that she ignores the fact that Kim lost a beloved family member and pressuring me into treating Kim more badly. Jess even told me, that it feels like we are breaking up/drifting apart  at the moment. She then blocked me and since then I am sitting at work, not able to get my head around it.   \nSo am I the asshole for beeing friendly to the mother of my daugther who is a former FWB.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: Expressed sincere condolences to the mother of my daughter after she lost her grandmother. Now my GF blocked me and accuses me of beeing too friendly and nice towards her.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok so, I’m  only a teenager so a bit of a rookie when it comes to relationships. Anyhow, I was dating a girl in my year level for a solid year and it was going well. Slow, but well. Mid-way through the year I started to notice that she was hanging out with a guy from her class a lot more than she was hanging out with me. I didn’t really take much notice of it, but it got to the point where even my friends were saying to me that I should be worried, so I asked her whether I should be worried about how much time they’re spending together. She assured me that no, I didn’t have anything to worry about at all. Even after I’d voiced my concerns to her, she continued to hang out with him even more and i once again voiced my concerns. She got pretty mad at me and we got into a heated discussion, through which I found out that he had told her to her face that he likes her. Now to me, this made me even more worried, because even though she knew that he liked her, she still hung out with him. Anyway, this continued for a few weeks in a vicious cycle, at the end of which I broke up with her. AITA? ",

      "description": "we're both 24 and been together for 2 years, and I just got promoted to a very stressful role in software sales in July and the amount of stress of having to hit targets/quotas per quarter is insane and it was giving me crazy anxiety and making me really sad. I've been feeling this way since I got into the software sales industry out of college because of having to hit quotas but now with the promotion its even more stress. But the thing is that I hold it all in from my GF, family and friends and I sometimes just cry in the shower. I don't want to seem weak to my GF and complain about my job to my parents so I just deal with it, but its been fucking me up mentally so badly. \n\nI started seeing a therapist in December and its been helping a good amount, I've made some good progress and she has experience working with people dealing with high amounts of work stress. I get reminded of my appts, which are once a week for 1 hour by text message 24 hours in advance and on Sunday mid day my GF was over and I got the text reminder about my appt on monday at 4. My GF saw this and googled the name of the therapist and found everything out, when I was in the shower and when I got out she was furious for not telling her anything and going behind her back seeing a therapist and she was yelling at me a lot saying how could I keep this from her and calling me an ass for hiding it. I just broke down crying and apologized a lot saying I didn't know how to tell her but I was going to one day. She's been very dry and mad at me since and wants to take a break.\n\nAITA?",

Different culture, but still in love?\n\nI called him for New Years, he experienced it first, not because he asked me to (he didn’t even elude to the need) but because I wanted to be with him then. He was spending it low key at home by choice. He actually made me cry over Skype, prodding me about something else - he was clearly drunk - and then just left... the call. So, 11ish hours pass, and I’m next on the New Years countdown. He didn’t text me much all day, because he was asleep but even when awake, I sent him some snaps of my dinner (NYE is a big fam tradition in my culture) and he just curtly responded with pleasantries. Clock struck 12.... he wasn’t even around to say congrats, with a half hour delay to every whatsapp I sent. I am ignoring him today, because I’m so angry, but also over it, but mostly angry and not over it at all. So, am I the asshole for thinking the least he could do was give me a ring?

      "description": "This one will need a little explanation. In my house, both of my parents works, while me, my older brother and my younger sister are students. Me and my sister are on high school while my older brother is on his last year at a very prestigious and expensive college (1/4 of the monthly household income goes to pay its monthly tuition). \nUntil 2 or 3 years ago my mother was responsible for doing all the housework on her own aside from her regular work. Then my father (he’s out at work almost all day long) told us that we needed to change that and that everyone should be cleaning their own mess and helping with cleaning the kitchen. So he proposed that everyone would (in addition to doing other stuff) be responsible for a day of the week (as an example: I would be responsible for every Monday and Friday, and my sister with Sunday) and everyone on the family agreed with their days. It was decided that me and my brother would have each 2 days of the week and everyone else would have 1 day of the week. This worked for the first two weeks or so then my sister and my brother started to “have something more important to do” so it would always end up with the person of the next day (usually me or my mom) cleaning stuff from the day before.\nAs it wasn’t working, this year we decided to change the schedules so everyone could have time for it. And those 2 still always had excuses almost every time and would only do it after my mom gets angry and started to scream at them. It worked with my sister but my brother would just go and sleep on his girlfriend’s house and comeback when it wasn’t his day anymore.\nSo, last night, my mom asked him to do something (I can’t remember what) but he didn’t and he and my mom started fighting because she said that he doesn’t help enough and that he should be helping more (he’s already at summer break) now that he got time and he responded saying that he helps just as much as everyone. Then I (i was in my bedroom at the moment) told him that he didn’t and we also started to fight. I’ve been pissed about the way he’s been acting for a long time and every time I saw my mother having to do his job I got more pissed. So last night I’ve finally told him that. I told him that he was being a terrible son because not only was he making the family pay a fortune for his education, he also never did anything that wasn’t about him and as he’s the more “expensive” son he should be working more than everyone in the house. After I said that he stopped arguing and shut up. \nSo today my mom said that he was very sad, that I hurt his feelings and that I shouldn’t have said those things. Now everyone is saying that I need to apologize to him. I said that he’s the one who needs to apologize for acting that way for so long, and they said I was being stubborn. \nI would really like some insight on this situation.\n",

      "description": "So in 10th grade, this guy from my school (we’ll call him R) found me from tumblr and started following me around school. It was kinda creepy, but I didn’t think much of it. But one day, R comes to school, guitar in one hand and a bouquet full of flowers in the other, surrounded by all his friends. They push me to the center of the quad area at school, in front of EVERYONE, and R starts performing a song he had written to ask me out on a date. I’m mortified. He, all his friends who helped orchestrate this, EVERYONE, is just STARING at me.  Keep in mind, I hardly even knew who this guy was. He literally just found me online and started stalking me. I finally manage to say “um R. Can we talk privately?” I pull him aside and say that while I appreciate the song, I would rather just be friends. R got PISSED. He starts guilt tripping me saying stuff like “I set aside EVERYTHING to do this for you!” as if I EVER showed any romantic interest and as if I EVER even asked him to do any of that. But, R still accepts to just being my friend.\n\nExcept he didn’t treat me like his friend. From then on, R tried controlling every aspect of my life as if we were dating. He would get angry at me for hanging out with my friends and not him. He wanted me texting him at ALL times during the day and wouldn’t let me sleep just so I had more time to talk to him. if I fell asleep I would wake up to tons of angry messages asking where I was, calling me horrible names. He would stalk all of my social media so he could see if I was online and scream at me if I was and just not responding to him. I lost so much weight because of how stressed I was. I must have lost 5 days of sleep to avoid R’s awful, abusive messages. I had to start changing my route to my classes at school because if R ran into me, he would start berating at me right then and there, in front of everyone. \n\nFinally, summer comes and I’m able to avoid R. I fled all my social media, remade, and blocked him on everything. The next school year comes, and I become really good friends with this girl we’ll call S. We ended up becoming best friends and we vented to each other often. Of course, R came up while we were talking and I told her everything and she was horrified that I had to go through something like that. Until a couple months later, S and R start dating??? I was floored. i kept telling S “I’m glad you’re happy, but I don’t really feel comfortable hanging out with you because of what R did”. S says “What did R even do to you?” I tried again and again to remind her what R did and that she was welcome to date him but I wasn’t sure if I could remain friends with her because of how much I feared for my own safety, but then after a couple weeks she would immediately forget what R had put me through. S and I started growing distant because of this, until finally, for my own mental health and well-being, I stopped talking to her. \n\nTL;DR: AITA for cutting off a friend because she knowingly dated my stalker?",

It was late at night and over the phone (she'd refused to see me in person) so we were both rather tired. I was trying to explain to her how it upset me that she'd chosen people who had wronged her over me. The conversation was a little like this. \n\nShe: Well, I think x is a very nice person.\n\nMe: &lt;I was tired and this was sort of a reflex&gt; Hmm.\n\nShe: WHAT? GO ON!\n\nMe: It doesn't matter.\n\nShe: Then don't say anything! If you're not going to follow it up then don't fucking say anything!\n\nMe: I'm tired and it was an accident. I understand, I'm sorry.\n\nShe: Well you've got to say it now.\n\nMe: Fine! It's just I know a lot about what x has done to people and I don't think x is a nice person at all, okay?\n\nShe then flipped out at me over my choice of words, being \"I know a lot\". She got really aggressive, mocked the way I said it, claimed it was unusual behaviour because I was just pretending to know a lot when I really don't. She then said it implies that I think I know more than her or that I have the full picture, which in both cases would be wrong, and it apparently also implies that I go around gathering info for the sake of condemning people like some sort of creep. According to her I've said this before without following it up with anything substantial and she finds it unnerving and annoying. \n\nI was really taken aback and a little hurt by what she said. It would have been easy to bite back, but instead I took a moment to catch my breath before responding calmly but sternly.\n\nMe: I don't think I know more than you, though I might, nor do I think I have the full picture, I don't even think it's possible for anyone to. It's just that I do know a lot about this because my friends -- who have been hurt by this person -- have vented to me about it and I like to support my friends when they're hurt. I don't follow it up because being considered trustworthy comes with the responsibility of not spilling the stuff they tell me. I don't see the full picture, you're right, but I see enough of the pain they've caused to know that I think they're an arsehole and I want nothing to do with them. Is that reasonable?\n\nShe stammered for a moment before conceding that perhaps it was, but I can't help but feel that by having unintentionally provoked her I was the arsehole in this situation. Any idea? Thanks.",

      "description": "So Tuesday it was raining and I saw someone walking home from my office. I have never even seen her until this point, but I knew she just came out of my office so I offer her a ride. She smelled like such an old dirty ashtray that I was gagging. Before she got out of the car, she asked me if I could pick her up on the way (Wednesday), I said no and explained I was really sensitive to the cigarette smell. She said she understood. Wednesday after work she runs up to me and tells me she hasn't smoked all night if I can give her a ride.. my dumbass didn't smell her. She now reeked of too much perfume and cigarettes... So tonight she approached me AGAIN about giving her a ride and I flat out refused. She started yelling because I'm expected a female to walk home alone after 11pm (which was what she had to be before Tuesday) and that she's literally on the way (I drive past her driveway). AITA for not giving her a ride so late when I go directly past her house?? We live in FL so it's not snowing.",

      "description": "So I dated this girl a while back and it was great and all, however there was one thing I always couldnt stand. So she went to school at a local community college and would hangout in the game room in her free time. Fine whatever, do you, but she said at the very beginning of the relationship that sometimes her guy friends would slap her butt while they're playing pool or something like that. Immediately I was caught off guard because who does that with their friend who is a girl. Anyway I kind of brushed it off but at the same time deep down I knew it would bother me if I saw it. Fast forward a few months we have a fight cause of this situation and she is saying things like why cant you just be okay with it, things like that. I said something along the lines of if I were there and saw that happen that I would get mad possibly fight the dude if a guy slaps my girlfriends ass in front of me. Her response was, they wouldn't do that in front of you. I said if they wouldn't do it in front of me they know better than to do it behind my back. \n\nLong story short im not entirely sure how many times this happened in our relationship, however whenever I asked her about it or maybe even sway her into seeing it my way she would kind of just be like why cant you just be okay with this.",

      "description": "I had to cut this down a lot.\n\nNew Year's 2017, my ex (A) broke up with me right before a party we planned. They broke up with me with their boyfriend (B) in the room (polyamory), even though I begged A not to involve him. At the time, it was because I was clingy and overly jealous of B which I agree was an issue.\n\nA month before, they and our mutual friends C and D all made a group behind my back \"for a safe space away from me to talk about my issues\". They never told me what issues they had.\n\nB and his friends were shit talking me at school and my sadness turned into anger. I was in a server to talk to other friends and move on, and my first overly questionable thing happens. I was in our vent channel, and I drew me stabbing B to death. B came to me later about how I threatened to kill him. I was confused on how he found it, since I shared that where he shouldn't have seen it. I found out that C was leaking the logs of that chat.\n\nA B and C would continue to vent about me on Vent (a social media app for talking about your emotions) with aggressive posts about how \"abusive\" I was, until about April 2017. As far as I knew.\n\nBetween then and now, we had a few good conversations. I still had anxiety seeing them.\n\nApril 2018: I got a job at a hardware store, and it turns out A was hired the day I came in for orientation. I had an anxiety attack. I vented about it and told my friends about it.\n\nLater, A informed me that them, B, C, and D moved in together. A, B, and C started dating.\n\nI was discussing plans w/ D to get my pal Z out of his impoverished home, but D went radio silent on the both of us. However, he was constantly posting art with the rest of the house. \n\nA week later, I get a desperate call from Z.\n\nD broke up with Z because \"he was an abuser\", and now everyone in that house is fuckin. I. Was. Angry. They pulled the exact same shit on Z that they did me.\n\nB messages me, saying I'm \"getting myself involved with someone who will strip me of all my money\". I call his BS, and he starts sending me screenshots of Z and B saying \"shit\" about me. All the things said in those screenshots were things Z's issues that have been handled.\n\nI check his Tumblr, and it turns out he was talking about my vents.\n\nI proceed to make a vent that says, \"How can you say I'm not over it when you guys are stalking me?\" Then brand new accounts made that day comment, made by A and B to rant at me. Are you kidding me?\n\nZ and I start looking through the accounts and they all were talking shit for a long time now.\n\nIt became a war, me flinging their hypocrisies and questions at them, while they sling insults.\n\nIt came to a climax of me posting a joke OC on my deviantART, making fun of B's horrible art, all of them getting engaged after a month, and their behavior. B sent me death threats.\n\nI reported the death threats to work.\n\nAll of them have been posting shit since saying I'm a dumb lazy whore.\n\nTo put it simply, AITA for retaliating?",

      "description": "My bf (43 M) - we'll call him Jack - and I (42 F) have been together 2 years. We have a good relationship but communication is not always one of our strengths.\n\nA little background information: I have a teenage daughter who recently witnessed a violent crime. She already has mental health issues, and was already suicidal, so this violent crime caused a pretty serious exacerbation in her condition.  Raising kids is hard enough without mental illness, but you add an exacerbation like that into the mix, and I needed a friend to talk to.\n\nJack and I spent the afternoon today with his sister, and I was talking to her about the situation, how we were dealing with my daughter, and how I was handling everything. Jack interrupted me several times during the conversation, took over and changed the conversation to something completely different, excluding me from it completely, and then got mad when I got upset with him. Then he came over and tried to give me a kiss to \"make up\", but he sat on my bad knee (partially torn meniscus and bone spurs) and got mad when I pushed him away and told him to get off me (he's 6'0\", 280lbs).\n\nWe went home, I iced me knee for a little bit, and we went to our friends' house for dinner and to see our god-daughter. We weren't there more than 10-15 minutes before I started talking to our friend - we'll call her Dori - about the situation. Jack stopped playing with our god-daughter and interrupted our conversation from across the room twice in order to tell stories that were completely unrelated to what Dori and I were talking about. After the second time, I got fed-up and said that I was tired of being interrupted, that I was leaving, and that he could call me when he was ready to come home. He said \"Fine then, be a bitch about it\". \n\nI've been called worse things in my life, but this was a conversation that was important to me, and I felt disrespected every time he interrupted me. That made five times just this afternoon, that he stopped me from talking about this situation that, quite frankly could end my daughter's life if she doesn't recover from the worsened suicidality, and I didn't feel I deserved to be called a bitch when I called him out on it. He says I shouldn't have walked out on our friends, that I should have just accepted his apology immediately and stayed for dinner as planned (we were having soup and garlic bread. Nothing fancy).\n\nSo what do you think? AITA?",

      "description": "My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was 12. My mother cheated on my father, then kicked him out of the house. My mom has bipolar disorder and anger problems. She physically and emotionally abused me badly from 12-22, when I finally was able to leave the country to get away from her and thus not see her for holidays, etc where, even when I was an adult, she would find an excuse to berate and hit me. \n\nI still suffer from Complex-PTSD due to the abuse, which was life threatening at times. This continues to affect my day to day life. I have been on 12 different psychiatric meds, have had other trauma imposed on me in part due to this abuse, and I have dashed any and all hope of starting my own family in fear of continuing the cycle. \n\nA few years later, I am planning my first trip home to see my family with my husband. My mom wants to make sure she sees me more than my dad does, and says she's afraid I'll \"blow her off\" to spend time with him, and is angry that I \"always take his side\". She feels \"disregarded\". I told her that the only reason she perceives favoritism from me towards my father is due to the lack of abuse in that relationship.\n\nShe is angry and says I'm \"raking her over the coals\" for what she's done. And she guilts me by saying that \"those parts of the past bring up guilt and regret for me\" and \"I've been punished enough\". She really does feel that I am unnecessarily punishing her for what she's done and that I should forgive her and never mention it again. Which I would do, and I have forgiven her (to her face) to an extent, but there are nonetheless lasting consequences, one of them being I prefer spending time with my father. I still am not safe from harm with my mother as an adult, so I find it hard to get as excited about seeing her.\n\nShe has helped me with lots of things in my life, despite the abuse, and continues to do so. She feels angry that she doesn't get \"credit\" for this, although I always thank her profusely and try to help her whenever I can as well.\n\nI don't know what to say to her about this - I genuinely can't tell if I am the asshole for not completely forgiving and forgetting, and if my preference for spending time with my father is an insult to my mother or if it's just conditioning. \n\n\ntldr; Am I the asshole for wanting to spend more time with my father because of my mother's abuse during my childhood?",

      "description": "Hey guys!\n\nSome background info: My grandfather is 88 and we are not super close. He was not a particularly great man to his family and actually refused to acknowledge me and my brother until we were 6 years old. I care about my grandfather, but none of this situation is making me tearful or particularly sad. When I've gone to visit my grandfather with my mom it is mostly as a show of support for her, as I know she has a lot of mixed emotions about him dying and dealing with her family has been hell.\n\nI currently live with my father in my parents' hometown, where my grandfather is dying in a skilled nursing facility. My mom lives 2 hours away. Both of them are married they just live apart. My childhood friends are where my mom is, so I head there on weekends/breaks from classes to hang out with them and work for my friend in retail for some extra cash. I usually carpool with whomever is going that way because it doesn't usually make sense to take two cars.\n\nThis particular weekend I went with my mom back with the intention of staying all week and I agreed to work for my friend until saturday evening. My dad was going to come up this way later on in the week and I was going to go back with him.\n\nLate last night my mom got the call that my grandfather is actively dying and she wanted to leave immediately. I chose not to go with her because of plans I've already made and because I don't want to leave my friend high and dry on a saturday. I could have texted her but knowing her, she was probably asleep. So now the plan is that my dad is driving out my way saturday just to drive back with me the next day which I know is inconvenient. \n\nI feel bad that I am making my dad drive out to come grab me, but also feel justified because I made my schedule long before and would feel bad about ditching my friend on a busy day. I know she would understand, but I don't want to put her in a shitty position either. I want to support my mom, but he is not my father and it's not MY uncomfortable feelings about his passing to handle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He says that I racially profiled him and that I am a racist that he should beat up. Security was right next to me so this thankfully was avoided. He proceeded to chew out my manager about me.

When my one friend drinks, she acts very much like a stereotypical drunk girl, not sure how much is due to actually being drunk or her just really playing into it, regardless, she is quite a handful. So when I invited them I explicitly said that I did not want to be looking after anyone all night and my other friend agreed as last time we both kind of ruined our night looking after/worrying about drunk friend wandering off and being wild. \n\nDrunk friend said that we find her too wild no matter what and just not to worry about her the whole night and let her do her thing. We explained we will worry if she gets as drunk as last time as a 5’ intoxicated girl alone in a random frat isn’t a good mix. We suggested that she not to drink as much but she took offense and got salty. So she’s not coming and she is kinda pissed about it. I understand where she is coming from but she could just not drink as much or behave better. \n\nWere we being rude when pointing out that she is a lot to handle when drunk ? Should we have just insisted she come anyway?\n\n\nTLDR: told my good friend not to be a silly drunk (she usually is) when we go out as I didn’t want to worry about someone all night.

A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n",

She and I are in year 3 of living together. We're all STEM majors except for the youngest one and she is also the only one of us who's vegan. I don't necessarily mind the fact she's a vegan at all, except that eating with her becomes really really tiresome because it quickly becomes a lecture about morality, how she's doing less damage, you're a terrible person for eating meat, etc etc. Basically, you can't just enjoy a meal together because she has to say something. \n\nShe's also tried to lecture me over my insect collection for entomology. I'm currently enrolled in entomology and hope to go to grad school for it. The collection required me to kill and pin insects, and she kept telling me how cruel it is, their blood is on my hands (never mind the fact insects have hemolymph, not blood, which I wanted to tell her but did not because I figured it wouldn't help), etc etc. as if I enjoyed the action of having to kill 40+ insects to display their dead bodies. I had to do it for a grade. How else do you think they get insects you see pinned and displayed like in museums and insectariums? \n\nWhenever she used to ask to eat with me, I'd make up some lie about how I was waiting for someone already or I had to leave soon anyway. But I've had a rough month and this time I straight-up told her no because I wasn't in the mood for a lecture about my meal. I also told her I'm fine with her being vegan, but her guilt-tripping and lectures on morality are seriously getting old fast and makes being around her something I don't enjoy.

I rarely spend time at home, I work and i go out and really am only here mostly to sleep, shower, and on the weekends when I spend mornings with them. \n\nMy stepbrother is a teacher so he's gonna from like 7am-5pm and my sister stays at home with the baby. \n\nBefore they moved in, our house was pretty clean. My brother is 15 and he's at school all day and when he's not, he's in his room. My stepdad and Mom work all day so since the house is almost always empty everything was always tidy. \n\nEver since they moved in it's been much, much messier. They cook often and don't wash the dishes right away, the share my bathroom with me and now we only have one bathroom because my sister fell in the other tub and broke it with her knee so they have to get it fixed. \n\nI have cleaned the bathroom/bathtub the last 3 times they've needed to be cleaned mostly because I feel gross in it knowing no one else has cleaned it. I rarely wash dishes unless I use then since I don't cook and am hardly home. \n\nToday is my 1 day off from work, I worked the last 6 days straight and I was looking forward to literally just vegging out in my bed. My mom called me to ask if he could put away/wash the dishes and clean the bathroom. I'm really annoyed because the dishes are not mine and I've cleaned the bathroom every time it's needed to be cleaned since they moved in. \n\nI'm going to do it regardless bc it's gross but my mom knows I complain about it and she says I need to help because I also live here and this house isn't a hotel. I understand that but I also don't feel like it's my responsibility to clean after them :/ I don't mind cleaning especially the bathroom but it's just so annoying that I'm expected to do it. I'd feel much better about it if it was asked of me as a favor rather than being expected of me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for being annoyed? I get they have a brand new baby but the difference from how clean our house used to be to how it is now is astounding. It's frustrating to be in a house so messy which is another reason why I'm not around often. \n\nI guess I'd just like to know if I'm being a dick for being upset with them even though they have a new baby.

      "description": "So I'm changing to a new division, and my manager is giving me a final review. In the past, he gave me positive reviews. But then, he put me on duties that don't match my job function. \n\nI have a degree from a good university and a pretty tough-to-get professional license for a specific type of job. This manager is has a degree in a different but semi-related field. For no reason at all, he put me on jobs in his field, rather than my own. He holds me up to his standards. Not only do I hate the field, but his standards are unfair. He works 60-70 hours a week and I did not sign up or that kind of job. \n\nHe has been giving me lower reviews because of lower performance. I deserve those reviews because I legitimately cannot perform the job very well, because it's literally not my job. The reviews, while lower, are still fair, I won't get in trouble or anything.\n\nI recently found out I'm changing divisions, and doing my old job. Very excited. But he angrily / begrudgingly asked me to send another review request for my final month on this current job. \n\nI have a strong feeling he will give me a negative review that will impact my job. \n\n---\n\nThere are a few things I kept secret from upper management. This manager is not a nice person, but I hate causing trouble. He has been sexist towards me, he refuses to help me when I needed it, he yelled at me because he was angry at his personal life. He was racist towards me as well, he is white and I'm not. And he has made me feel inadequate more than once. \n\nBut I sucked it up because making him happy equates to getting high reviews. As I said, he was a dick, but he still gave good reviews, so I forgave him. \n\nHowever, now my job reputation's on the line. If he gives me a bad review here, I intend on complaining to upper management about all of these things I've been holding back (and being honest and saying that I didn't bring it up because I didn't want to cause trouble, but I'm bringing it up now because I feel he gave an unfair review). \n\nIf he gives me an OK review, I'll let it go. If he throws me under the bus, I'm dragging him with me. \n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "So I was eating alone at a coffee shop the other night. Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Ok so I'm doing about 40 coming off of my home street onto the avenue that leads to the freeway. Im alerted by my sister suddenly that someone is in the road, and sure enough there was. Only it wasnt a jaywalker or someone else just trying to get across. It was a skateboarder. And where else to be than in the MIDDLE lane. And its not like its an out of the way street either. At NO point is there NOT a car on this road so this is some entitled shit right here.\nSo I'm behind him trying to get passed and he starts swerving in and out of lanes. He then looks back at me and raises an incredulous arm like im some sort of prick and proceeds to immediatly wipe out HARD directly in front of my speeding car.\nI BARELY managed to swerve out of his way and for one incredibly surreal moment lock eyes with him as my tire misses his head on the road by INCHES. Now that I think of it its amazing the back wheels didnt tear him to shreds. I only got a glimpse of him in my rearview to see he had managed to hobble out of the street in order to avoid the cars behind me.\nAm i some sort of cunt, or does this guy deserve the Darwin Award?",

      "description": "There is a girl in my dorm at school who is amazing. She's funny, smart, and beautiful but she's also very introverted and the kind of girl who likes to stay in rather than go out drinking and partying. We both are history nerds and really connected on that level when we met. We have interesting and deep talks whenever we see each other in the dorm. We had a class together in the fall and worked on a group project together and she laughed at all my jokes and put a smiling emoji in every text she sent me. She would meet up with me without makeup and in pajamas so I could tell she's comfortable around me in a way she isn't around other people. I have really fallen for her and over winter break I decided that I was going to make it known that I was interested.\n\nThe thing is, she has a boyfriend, but I can tell he isn't right for her. He's very into the fraternity scene (a multicultural frat that is known for out of control parties and hazing). He's loud and talks to other girls in the dorm all the time. He constantly gets into loud political arguments with people and basically doesn't know the meaning of civility. He's basically the opposite of this girl and I can tell they aren't a good match. Once she even told me that he was dragging her out to a bar and she was nervous about it because, like I said, it's not her scene. She was wearing lots of makeup too which is just not her genuine self.\n\nSo I finally decided I was going to tell her that I'm an option, and let her make her choice. I just sent her a message confessing how I felt and letting her know that I'm open to being with her. I didn't put any pressure on her, I just wanted her to know. She didn't respond politely, she got mad and told me to fuck off. I sent a few more messages but let it drop, but then her boyfriend showed up at my room and told me to leave her alone, which seems like over the top behavior from a guy who can't stand not being in control of every situation.\n\nI was just trying to give her another option but now she won't speak to me. AITA just for putting it out there that I had feelings for her?",

      "description": "A little background: I am a spray tan tech at a salon and just secured a weekly client. This client (we’ll call her K) came in for her 2nd spray tan this evening. She’s a little rough around the edges, but a very pleasant lady and I enjoy our conversation. As she was paying today, she gave me a $20 tip, which is the most anyone has ever tipped me. I was floored and it made me tear up a little. However, as K was leaving in her vehicle, she flat out rammed some other poor girls car and left the scene, almost hitting another car as well. I didn’t see this happen, but two other customers did, and came in to let us know what had happened. They saw her walk out of the salon. When they described her to me, as well as her car, I knew exactly who she was. (Descriptively, there’s no mistaking her.)  The girl who’s car was hit was still in the salon, so I told her when she came out to the lobby and went out to look at the damage with her. There wasn’t too much damage, but I told her I had the info if she needed to make a police report/insurance claim. She called her mom, who insisted that she make a police report. The officer then came into the salon and asked for K’s info, so I gave it to him. \n\nI feel awful for being part of getting her into trouble. I’m sure she will probably be charged for this. I feel conflicted and if she knows it was me who gave her info, I’m sure I will lose her as a client. Did I do the right thing, or am I the asshole here?",

John and I are similar in every way. I’m the girl version of him. Sarcastic and friendly. We tried dating once and he handled that badly by saying I wouldn’t be good enough for him. (Should have read that as a warning)\n\nSo fast forward to July of this year (we worked at the same place together for 2 years) During those two years we hooked up on many occasions. Later I started to fall in love with him and I finally said something in July and he told me he has a girlfriend and that and I quote: “you’re looking for someone to lean on because your mom has cancer” he was the only person who was there for me in a hard time. \n\nFast forward to today: his dad was recently given two to six months to live with cancer and he texted me and asked me if we could hang out and I respectfully declined and told him I don’t want to go down that road.

      "description": "My grandmother passed away suddenly about 2 months ago, it was a very heartbreaking process and it took its toll on everyone. As we were walking through her house my mom told me and my brother separately that we both can have her tv, initially when I found out the mix up I said he can have it, then the next day as we were packing everything up he didn’t show up and texted 4 hours after we started that he got too high and couldn’t make it. I was incredibly mad about that and told him then he doesn’t just get the tv now because I had to move it and he left my mom and I out to dry during this emotional time. He threw a fit but I just ignored it. Cut to 3 days ago at the celebration of life for her. He tells me mom told him he could have it and to it move for him because he’s not strong enough to pick it up, I said no she didn’t say shit about her tv at what essentially her moms wake (confirmed) and he’s just being a prick and we will talk about tomorrow or just another time, and that this was an inappropriate. He drops his shoulder and walks through me and says no let’s go ask mom, I say again no we aren’t going and arguing and who gets the tv in front of our family now. He takes a step into me and gets nose to nose and says, “don’t get in my face” he’s a bitch and I have 80lbs of muscle on him, I took the bait and walked him out of the room face to face into a wall saying, “I’m in your face” over and over again, when we got to the wall he tried to push me away with his chin and it caught my teeth, no one saw any of it but the last seconds. Now I look like a crazy person who bit him in the face. I know I shouldn’t have taken the bait but the repeated disrespect and entitlement made to angry to also let him try to physically intimidate me. My dad tried to scream at me and ironically got in my face while doing so, so I refused to apologize in the moment. My mom knows us and believes my side of the story and but he still took the tv. My dad hasn’t responded to me since, neither has my brother. I tried explaining everything to him but I didn’t tell him about the getting too high to help part (parents are divorced for a while and he doesn’t approve of weed while my mom is the plug) because if I did he wouldn’t help my brother with his school anymore. He is paying for my last 2 semesters as well because my scholarship ran out, don’t add a second major in 8th semester kids unless you REALLY hated the first one, but he hasn’t sent me the money I need for books, I’m getting a job, I quit working which I had don’t since I was 13 at dads request since he was going to be giving me money for these last 3 semesters (from an education fund my grandpa set up for all the grandkids) and my girlfriend who I live with is a neuro icu nurse so I’ll be fine, worst comes to worse small student loans. So am I the asshole? I know I shouldn’t have taken the bait but I had been drinking and that was just the last straw. Also he texted my girlfriend after, “maybe you should be better in the bedroom and your boyfriend wouldn’t be trying to get kinky with other people” unprompted ",

I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it’s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, “I’m beat” and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn’t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it’d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend’s friend cut me off and said, “shocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it” in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself “well fuck you too”, but just said “actually nope” and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn’t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said “nah I’m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?”   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  “It’s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime”.  So I said, “ yeah I can play it anytime and I’m playing it now”.  Friend mumbled something I couldn’t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It’s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it’s like a switch flips and she’s a totally different person.  I don’t get it.   I don’t really want to, I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  ",

      "description": "Ex and I met when I was studying in his country. Towards the end of my time there I moved in with him for four months. I had to leave when my visa expired. But we were getting serious (spent weekends and Christmas with his family) so we decided to stay in a LDR until we figure something out.\n\nDuring the last year, we both spent our holidays visiting each other every other month (it is a 10+ hours international flight plus trains. It is a lot effort and money we both put in this relationship and I believe it was getting stronger).\n\nThree weeks ago on our holiday together I decided to asked if he wanted to get married as it was a way of me moving back. He said we only saw each other on holidays and always had a good time together, but we haven't really lived together for a long time so he didn't know. I didn't blame him but it made no sense to do LDR anymore if we never get together.\n\nAnother reason is I noticed he has been texting someone a lot. My gut told me something was off but I never confront him.\n\nInitially I said we should take a break (I am visiting his country in April so we could talk again then). We both cried a lot. After more talk we kinda just broke up. The next morning when I calmed down I asked if he would consider to move to my country for a year. We could spend more time together to find out if marriage was right for us. He was nodding a lot and said he would look into it.\n\nIt has been three weeks since and we have been texting every day until last Friday. We were supposed to video-chat on Saturday but he never replied to my messages and didn’t pick up my phone-call. This never happened and I really freaked out, imaging everything that could go wrong for him. I reached out to his sister and asked if she had heard from him. A few minutes later he texted and said he just didn't notice the time everything is ok. So I texted him: Are we ok then? I can understand if you wanna stop talking for a while but silence punishment is too harsh. I was really worried. He replied that he didn't deliberately do it, the truth is he has stayed over with a friend - a girl. He didn't mention it because he thought it would upset me.\n\nI called and he picked it up this time, then I realized he was still at her place. I told him that I don't blame him because I asked to end it. But I thought we kinda left things open and were still working on it. He argued that this girl is just a friend (who he talked to before we met, then stopped, then started talking to again recently) and nothing happened. And even if it were something he should be free to do so since I broke up with him. I agreed, but it still really upsets me. I also know now this is the girl he had been texting a lot even before I broke up with him.\n\nIt has been a few hours since we spoke and he is still staying with that girl. I feel shit . AITA for being upset or calling him when he is at her's？\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "5 Months ago a friend of mine, we'll call her Jane, was approached by her husband who had decided that after 3 years of marriage he wanted a poly relationship. She refused and multiple fights ensued. Jane reached out to a married pair of mutual friends to see if she could move in with them. They didn't have room for her, they were staying in a 1 bedroom loft apartment. They then reached out to my wife and I to see if she could stay with us, since we had a guest room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe agreed and she moves in with us and our 4 kids. Since she works at a big box store and doesn't make a lot of money, we tell her she can pay rent in helping my wife(SAHM) with the house and kids as well as work towards getting a license and a full time job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn December she tells us that she interviewed for a position at a company in phone sales, but was turned down and told to apply for a different position in Jan. We started taking her driving and teach her all we can, however the state has a very particular way to parallel park that I don't know (I learned in a different state) and tell her she needs to have a driving school teach her for like 100 bucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeb rolls around, the company doesn't post a job opening and I tell her to start applying elsewhere...to this day, I think she's put in 2 applications. I also ask if she's set a date to have her license by, she says \"I haven't but if you want me to I can\", I say it would be good so go ahead and do it. She stops helping as much around the house and starts staying in her room until 30 min to an hour before her shift starts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Feb, we buy a new house and I pay to have all of our stuff, including hers, moved. On closing/moving day we find out that Jane has a doctor's appointment AND has to work, she also hasn't gotten a ride for either. Moving is finished and Jane complains about the room (2nd largest in the house, with her own bathroom). She complains about the movers. She complains about everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn March I tell Jane she needs to get her license by the end of the month. She gets salty but agrees. She tells my wife she has no money, but made the appointment anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week is the straw that broke the camel's back. Jane is hooking up with a guy at work (who has a gf), he applies for a 3rd shift manager position. Doesn't have it, just applied. Jane VOLUNTEERS to go to 3rd shift. No consulting her only way to get to work/back. I'm fucking livid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell my wife I'm done and want her out. My wife says to wait until the end of the month to give her notice and give her a chance to get her license since I told her to get it by the end of march. AITA for being completely done and wanting her out regardless?",

      "description": "For the last 4 years I (M23) have constantly been trying to get out more and do my own thing during holidays instead of just tagging along with my parents. Nothing too fancy usually. Going to a bar, eating at the 10$ all you can eat chinese restaurant, grill party, paintball, etc. It was also then when I noticed that my friends had poor budgeting skills. Usually they came once, escalated it (e.g. renting out the whole VIP lounge or renting a limo), then had absolutely zero money (if they didn't get themselves in debt for it) for the rest of the week/month/year. I love to go on holiday, and while we've been to Prague last year, they usually can't go on holiday. \n\nBecause of that I had to learn to be happy travelling/eating alone, and I've picked up a \"tag along or leave it\" mentality. I maybe ask once if someone wants to go anywhere and if nobody says anything I'll just say I'll go to X and tell them I'd be happy if someone comes but I'll go anyways. \n\nSince most of the time I'm going alone, I've started using more money. So instead of e.g. taking a 1h flight with easyjet I'll fly to America/Korea/etc., sometimes business for comfort. Or get a nice steak instead of fried chicken. \n\nNow for some reason this has pissed one of my friends off. He told me I was showing off and being fucking arrogant by asking them if they wanted to come, since they couldn't afford it anyways (technically they could if they stopped wasting it on pretending to be rich, but that's besides the point). AITA for doing things and trying to get my friends to be more active? Should I just fuck off without ever asking?",

Sure enough, the stock rose almost 4% that day, and i sold by days end.\n\nThough i realize my actions had nothing to due with what happened, and that the stock was going to go up regardless of whether i invested or not, I'm still genuinely curious if this makes me an asshole or just someone who seized on an opportunity?",

I should also clarify that I wasn't handling the paperwork here; I'm 14 and this was a family trip, I was barely involved.\n\nWe were passing through a final checkpoint, where some sort of verification was being done involving an officer. Around the time that we had arrived at the gate, I received a text, which I pulled out my phone to reply to without thinking about how disrespectful this may be (I'm still not really sure how it was, but I guess that's why I'm here). At that point, the officer looked at me and told me sternly to put it away. At that point I was thinking, \"okay, it's against protocol or something, I'll reply later.\"\n\nApparently not. As we walked away, he said to me in a sarcastic tone, \"it's *called* respect.\"\n\nOn one hand, I probably looked extremely entitled and I shouldn't be on my phone while I'm walking. On the other hand, I had no involvement in the vetting process, and I don't know if it was his place to tell me such a thing. Also, I was humiliated by the event, and it ruined my mood over the next few hours. \n\nI know I'm probably fixating on this too much, but I hate being yelled at or otherwise feeling \"called out\" in public, and I want to know if the officer was justified in acting as he did, and if I was being as disrespectful as he seemed to think.

She has her friends and I have mine and to get to the point, we are both in the band at the college (she's in the color guard) . And for those who don't know we band nerds change all the time together. The color guard changes separate and together as they are all made up of females. \n\nYesterday after my classes I was in one the band room's practice rooms, catching up on some work. When a friend of mine ,(we'll call her J) who is also in the guard and knows my gf, walks in and asks to change in there, to which i say yes. As I'm gathering my things in my pack she starts taking her clothes off. I then just grab my phone and leave my stuff there. \n\nJ then says \"you didn't have to leave\"\n\nTo which I respond \"it's a matter of respect\"\n\nThis small incident made me feel uncomfortable. So I did what I normally do. I talk to my girlfriend,(in this class text) I like to be transparent about everything with her.  She then takes this information and cold shoulders me, and just doesn't talk to me. I try to give her space, and she tells me how she feels after an evening with no communication.  I tell her I understand but I didn't like that she took her anger out on me. She tells me that I dont understand how she feels and that I'm being insensitive and I should just forget about it and it shouldn't be a big deal. And our conversation ends.\n\nI saw her on campus today, frustrated, we talk some more about it and I tell her that it's not right  that shes talking her frustration out on me when I came for help. And I dont see this as something that put our relationship progress back. And she then said I clearly dont understand, it would be the last time she came to me about problems. I then said that's shes in the wrong, I can understand jealousy or J being disrespectful to us, but it's not right to take it out on me, and the strain of the relationship that is happening right now comes from her, and that she is being the problem instead of dropping it like she said to. I can be kind and understanding but this is ridiculous.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I was on a date with my girlfriend and everything was going well. She was thinking about purchasing a fancy LED face mask when the conversation switched too their appliances, specifically Dyson products. I jokingly suggested we switch all our appliances to Dyson products, and that we could even replace the LED face mask with a vacuum you could use on your face. Ridiculous stuff but I was feeling a bit silly. \n\nMy girlfriend instantly froze and got extremely upset. Apparently a proper boyfriend would never dare suggest vacuuming his girlfriends face, and doing so is such an insult it borders on abuse. A couple points before I go further: my girlfriend is from Korea and English is her second language. There are definitely a couple cultural differences I’m (still) working on. \n\nI care a lot about her wellbeing and would never intentionally hurt her feelings, so I asked what about the comment was so abhorrent. I couldn’t come up with a clear answer as it’s so obviously an insult that even a kid should know not to say that. All her Korean girlfriends would immediately support her on this too, that a boyfriend should NEVER say something like this. It really is something only an asshole would do.\n\nFor some additional context, something similar did happen some years ago. I don’t remember the details, but my girlfriend jokingly chastised me for being messy. I jokingly replied back in a “no u”, and said she was dirty. I guess she thought I implied she was some kind of promiscuous girl and was so angry and upset she started crying. I kept a mental note never to joke around in ways that might be interpreted as demeaning her character. \n\nBut this last comment with the vacuum was so ridiculous, and the context so harmless, it hadn’t crossed my mind. And I’m still having a difficult time wrapping my head around how it could be interpreted to be that offensive. \n\nHope to see some nuanced answers here to help me understand what’s going on. ",

      "description": "  \n\nMy co-worker who I am not very close, nor do I like very much found out I was lesbian because he was eavesdropping into a conversation I was having with another also gay, co-worker (A) a friend of mine. Now I don’t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I’m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I’ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says “Oh you’re a lesbian?”\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. “yeah and what?” \n\nP looks at me and decides I’m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n“Wow you don’t look lesbian!”\n\nOk?\n\n“Have you dated other guys?”\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn’t for me \n\n“How do you know you like girls if you haven’t dated guys?”\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n“So, are you out with your parents?”\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: “Maybe your last relationship didn’t work out because you aren’t out? And maybe you like guys?”\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn’t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n“Well thank you for telling me. I’m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren’t and you’re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.” \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here’s the thing. I don’t care for anyone’s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won’t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n“Mate I know you mean well but I really don’t care what you think of my sexuality. I don’t need your acceptance or validation.”\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like “well I was just saying jeez you don’t have to be so rude” before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don’t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. ",

Its not life threateningly bad but I get sick more often than any other person in my house and when I do, its worse. As a child I had strep throat about 5 times a year and pneumonia at least 3 or 4 times in my life 1 nearly requiring hospitalization. \n\nI also suffer currently from the after effects of both mono and parvo because the viruses linger in my body. I am fully vaccinated and up to date on flu shots regularly.\n\nI live with my parents and 3 siblings. One of my brothers (17) is homeschooled and is very sick. With strep throat. He went to the doctor today and has antibiotics. He needs a whole 24 hours before hes non contagious.\n\nSo the asshole-ry in question is this, he came out of his room bundled in blankets and sniffling/generally being miserable and sick. He didnt want to access the tv or any livingroom amenities, he just wanted to be somewhere not his room. I was playing the communal ps4. I  told him if hes sick to stay in his room untill he starts getting better on antibiotics. I dont enjoy getting strep throat and I always get it if people near me have it. I am still recovering from whatever flu nonesense my youngest brother (10) brought home and I feel its a reasonable request that he not infect the entire house because he happens to be sick. My brother(17) stomped into his room and started screaming about it. \n\nAITA for requesting he respect my health and desire to not get sick or should I just accept Im getting sick and deal with it?",

      "description": "To preface this, the professor in question teaches a very large college class (easily 300+ students), so attendance is taken via these devices called iClickers, where you just press a button to take attendance.\n\nWhen I checked my grade, I was surprised to see a very low grade for my attendance. I definitely had perfect attendance in the class, so I emailed the professor stating my problem and asked if he could check the attendance record again. \n\nThe professor responds back:\n\n&gt;The recording of attendance is doen completely by machines and computers that do not make mistakes. The only human inv9olvement if by the person who puches the button. So there is nothing to check. But I havernoted your issue.\n\nI couldn't tell if the professor was simply being unprofessional, or if the professor was being sarcastic about human error and technology and intentionally made this many typos in his email.\n\nUltimately, I pretended that it was a normal email and thanked the professor for a quick response. \n\nI just wanted to know if I would have been (or appeared) to be an asshole if I responded back in the same manner as my professor with the intention of \"playing along\"?\n",

      "description": "One of my best friends is turning 21 in the coming weeks, and our group of about 7 guys (all 21+) had the idea to rent 2 hotel rooms in downtown for the night, drink, go to a strip club, and maybe hire an escort for the birthday boy for the night. Split between 7 of us for **just the hotel rooms**, the cost would be around 75-100 per person. This doesn't cover alcohol costs, escort costs, or the $25 in one dollar bills we were going to give the birthday boy to splurge at the club. I would assume the night in whole would come out to around $200-$225 pp. \n\nNormally I would have no issue paying this. However, I have an early work shift the following morning and am not planning on drinking, or staying the night in the hotel. My plan is to leave the hotel around midnight - 1 A.M. so that I can have at least a couple hours of sleep before my shift.\n\nWIBTA for not paying for a hotel room that I won't be sleeping in? ",

      "description": "I've had a group of friends that I'd hang out with for about a decade. A few months ago, I came to the realization that I have been the only one making the plans with them for as long as I could remember (they usually eagerly agree), and I've never been invited by them anywhere, although I see this group hanging around all the time on social media. I decided that I definitely cared a lot more about the relationship than they did, so I decided to stop making plans with them and waited for them to intiate conversations with me instead. Lo and behold, I haven't talked to them in 6 months and they didn't even contact me for my birthday (i'm still very salty). \n\nRecently, the one in the group I'm closest to, let's say Sarah, contacted me, only because I recently saw their mother passing by on the street. She asked me why we haven't been hanging out as much, to which I replied, \"You've never asked\". So Sarah asks if I'm down to hang out within the next week because she's available and so am I. The week is over, and once again she has not contacted me. I'm just fed up with how one-sided this relationship is, and I don't want to be the one that says, \"Why haven't you been inviting me to things/talking to me?\" because I don't want to come off as desperate. At this point, I'm not sure if there's anything that can be talked about, and after months of waiting and receiving nothing, I don't feel like theres much left of our friendship.

      "description": "To protect this persons privacy, I have changed their name to James. \n\nSo a little over a year ago I started to have feelings for James. It all started on the weekend after our marching band made it to area. We hung out after that and things went on from there.\n\nAbout two days later, James sent me a text asking for help. I didn’t think much of it. I really liked helping people. He then texted that he was having problems with his identity. Having come out as bi a month earlier to all this, I knew he was talking about his sexuality. I was happy to help him because I remembered how I felt going through his situation. I asked if he liked boys. He said he didn’t know. I asked if he liked girls. Same response. I had never actually helped someone with this before so I wasn’t sure how to help from there. Since it was late at night, we both said goodbye and went to bed.\n\nBefore I fell asleep I started to think that I could possibly shift James over to the “gayer” side of things. He was still questioning so he would think it was his choice anyways. So I started to hang around him more. We actually ended up being really good friends. Everything seemed alright.\n\nTwo weeks later, James told me that he liked a girl and he wanted me to be his wingman. Being the helpful person I was, I said yes. I was in emotional pain but I still said yes. Also we found out that we were going to state so I was trying extra hard not to seem sad. The next day I snapped and told him every single reason why his crush wouldn’t work. James came to terms with it, but he wasn’t too happy that I had to tell him. We became distant after that. I tried to cheer him up by confessing my feelings to him, but it made everything worse.\n\nWe didn’t talk much after that. We barely talk now. I feel bad for ruining my chances with him, ruining his chances with the girl he liked, and possibly messing him up mentally. \n\nAfter a whole year, I finally forgive myself for what I did and move on from James. But now James has led me on and cut me off at least twice. Not only am I not sure if I like him, but I’m blaming myself again for what I did a year ago.",

My brother attended the Trump rally after the Synagogue shooting and I voiced my liberal views. This is a pretty typical argument for my family which is fine, we vary in views and that's okay. \n\nThis one turned into a different brother chiming in. He said I take money and manipulate my parents into paying things for me. Very not true. I left home 8 years ago and moved across the country 2 years ago. He also started calling me a drug addict, which is weird seeing as he used to buy weed from me. He finalized his rant with calling me a tramp. \n\nI am the youngest of 5 and the onl girl in the family. I grew up being called a slut, whore, skank, my entire life from my brothers. Distancing myself from my family I have made enormous strides on my mental health and him calling me that made me feel destroyed again. \n\nI decided I would rather not spend my Christmas vacation subjecting myself to sexist and racist views so I told my mother I would not be going to her house. I'll be with one of my brothers, who is gay and also outcasted.

      "description": "I have a coworker who has become my friend over the past couple years but over the past eightish months, some of her behaviour at work is driving me completely insane. \n\nOur work has a lunch/break policy where you can either have a 15 min break and a 1 hour lunch or a 1 H 15 M lunch. Most people choose the longer lunch but my friend and I are both smokers (gross, I know) so we go for a smoke break in the mornings and used to take shortened lunches together. \n\nThis past summer she got a puppy and started going home at lunch to let the dog out and take it for a walk so we no longer have lunch together. In order to beat lunch time traffic, she started leaving for lunch half an hour earlier. She leaves at 11:30 instead of noon and claims to come back at 12:45. Which largely is not true as I walk by her desk around that time to get to mine from the lunch room. She is rarely at it, neither is her coat, meaning she is still out of the office. Also, that means she is taking the 1 H 15 M lunch although she continues to come for a smoke with me in the morning. \n\nShe also started taking a second smoke break in the afternoon with less than an hour left in her shift. So all in all, she is taking 2 hours worth of breaks/lunches everyday. \n\nOn top of that, she has been coming in an hour late every Friday for a month. She tells the firm she is going to physiology for her knee (she fell on the ice walking her dog) but told me she’s just been sleeping in and isn’t going to physio. \n\nAt our last staff meeting (three weeks ago) or HR manager said there are some complaints of certain individuals abusing the lunch/break policy and that if we choose the 15 M break, 1 H lunch option daily, to let her know. I sent HR an email stating I choose this option. \n\nMy friend on the other hand did not claiming she doesn’t think she needs to because she “stays late all the time.” This is also not true as she leaves before I do and comes to say goodbye. If she does stay late on a particular day it is very very rarely more than 15 M.  In total, she is taking 4 H 45 M a week of break time she shouldn’t be and I know for a fact she is not making that time up in anyway.\n\nShe complains to me and to HR about how busy she is and needs task taken away from her role. She pointed out to me today that another assistant is lazy because she takes a walk around the office twice a day. I’ve talked to her about coordinating her breaks with HR and about how taking them isn’t helping her workload. She snaps at me and says if she doesn’t do these things none of her work will get done because she’ll be so stressed. \n\nI’m having such a hard time letting this go. WIBTA for reporting her to HR?",

You see, in grade 3 or something, someone had written me a love note which i found years ago and framed it cause it was really silly and sweet and just as a reminder of how cute love is….\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe copied it word. for. word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he thought it was cute…which it is…but…well, it would have been cute after a year or 2 of dating…but 10 years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, i didn’t flip out or anything, but he saw my disappointment. I told him I loved the gesture, but was a little hurt that after 10 years the only words he could find to tell me how he felt were someone else's from decades ago. I know he was trying to be sweet and that it was kind and took effort, i just can’t help how i felt at the moment, but now i’m left feeling like a complete asshole. He understood, but I could tell he was deflated and embarrassed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my friends and I are planning to go on a 5d4n overseas trip in about a month. At first, I wanted it to be 3d2n but they think that its too short and thus its 5d4n. Right now, I'm asking them if it could be 4d3n instead but still I'm quite hesitant to go on the trip.\n\nAs for why I don't feel like going on that trip, I have a dog and I wouldn't really like to be away from her for days.\n\nAlso, I'm an only child and I'm worried about my dad as he would be home alone and he doesn't put in effort to eat proper food if he's alone. For example, he would just eat instant noodles and sometimes skip meals. My mother is busy working and I kind of feel really guilty for going on a trip to enjoy myself with friends. Thus, I find it hard to ask them if I could go on this trip but I think they would most likely allow me to go.\n\nMy family isn't exactly doing bad financially but I feel like I would rather spend my money on other things. I'm also starting a part time job right now and I don't feel comfortable asking for a leave.\n\nHowever, if I don't go on this trip, it would most likely get cancelled as my friend would be the only girl there and thus it would be awkward for her. \n\nMy friends are really looking forward to it so if I don't go I feel like they would be very unhappy, especially since they've planned out things and searched for accommodation and stuff. We haven't booked anything or paid for anything yet so its still not too late for me to cancel the trip. \n\nTL;DR: I don't want to go on the trip but I feel bad for not going as my friends are really excited about it and it would get cancelled if I don't go.",

We'd always joke around about how they're so good and how'd they'd beat most average joe's in a 1v1 or 3v3. I always thought they were joking at least, till one day I said that most avg joes would give you guys a run for your money at least you know? They didn't believe it and were used me as an example saying how if I got 2 other guys who are average joes they'd destroy us with another girl on their team. I thought it would be fun and I hadn't touched a basketball since July and my friends barely play. We got court space and we met up to play 3v3 and we wrecked them. Won a best 2/3 series to 21 and they scored 7 pts the first game and 5 pts the 2nd game LOL. There were people watching like their teammates and others at the gym and said we were being assholes/douches for playing so hard. But like they were talking shit so we did play hard and had no mercy basically. Also they had a height advantage, all of them are 6ft plus. I'm 5'9, my one buddy is like 5'5 maybe and one dude is maybe 6ft. \n\nAre we assholes for going so hard and embarrassing them?",

      "description": "I recieved a call off my sister today after not hearing from her in a while. We have a love hate relationship due to a lifetime of issues. Her son, my nephew has recently started nursery. She told me he had recently had fallen off a slide and bust his nose. The nursery hadn't called her to inform her of the incident, which is protocol. So she had gone to collect him and they explained what had happened but said he had been completely fine. She noticed he wasn't keeping his balance very well and was very unsettled. She took him to the doctors and he was diagnosed with concussion.\n\nI told my sister that she needed to take him out of the nursery as it was a serious thing to have occurred. I told her to bring my nephew to the nursery I am a deputy manager at. I said I would pick him up and take him to nursery. For the two days he would be attending nursery, he would be able to stay at our house. I made this suggestion without first consulting my SO for a few reasons. Firstly, I have never been in a position to have him stay, we haven't ever had the space, time or money. I am now in position to help and care for him. My sister is a very young mum and is struggling to cope. I offered to help because I have the resources to do so.\n\nSecondly, I knew my  SO would say no because he doesnt like kids. He doesn't know what to expect and always assumes the worst will happen.\n\nThis situation will be mine to deal with, and mine alone.  I will be responsible for him and my SO will not have to be involved in any way. I haven't seen my nephew in a year, not my choice. Now I have the opportunity to care for my nephew and offer him a steady routine whist he is at my house.\nQ\nMy SO is upset because I didn't run it past him first. He doesn't think I should have made the decision without him, which I understand. However when I asked him if we could just try it and see how it goes he agreed. However he is still angry because I didn't ask him first. AITA? ",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nLess am I “the” asshole because the other person is clearly not an asshole, more am I “an” asshole.\n\nI cancelled a date today for this weekend. 1st date, off of a dating app. What happened was I matched with someone even though the physical attraction for me seemed so-so. We had an okay conversation and we eventually agreed to meet this weekend.\n\nI am new to dating apps and since agreeing to this date, I have arranged dates with several other people who I am both more physically attracted to and have more common interests with. I did not realize there were this many people who might be interested in/interesting to me.\n\nMy conversation with this person has also flickered out. We are talking about very boring subjects, and it wasn’t that interesting to start with. I agreed to the date because I hadn’t had a date in a long time and I thought I could grow to like them if I gave them a chance.\n\nMy thoughts go like this: I do not really want to go on three dates this weekend, and talking to these people is exhausting. Furthermore, I think it is a waste of person #1’s time- who wants to be someone’s third choice that weekend? I think this person is objectively physically fine looking and a good person, just not my cup of tea. I feel for them because I would be sad if I was excited for a date and they cancelled, but at the same time, I would not want to waste my time on me if I were them either.\n\nSo I sent them a message saying I am too busy and not sure I will be less busy any time soon. I sent them this text on Tuesday, and our date was on Saturday at a coffee shop. I hope I gave them enough time to make other plans.\n\nAm I an asshole?",

I'm doing all my homework for the legality of both of these, so I'll be registering with my local council as an amateur beekeeper, and non-native plants will be carefully managed to ensure they don't start growing where they aren't supposed to. The bees will also be well-fed with other native flowers and a 1:1 cane sugar-water solution, standard in beekeeping. The plants will likely end up attracting and eating some bees, but even if all of the traps were filled with bees there's no way a whole hive would collapse from all its workers being eaten.\n\nSo Reddit, if I went forward with this, WIBTA?",

Soon, we went to the kitchen to get food &amp; we started to play-fight. We kept lightly kicking and hitting each other. Apparently, I kicked Mia (my sister) a little too hard and she started to cry. My dad had enough. He stormed over and he yelled at me to go to my room. He followed me in. He pushed me onto my bed and kicked me twice. Both times, he didn't hit me too hard, and he said \"Do you like it when someone kicks you!?\" It was only to prove a point, but I'm still kinda hurt/traumatized? I feel like I shouldn't, but I still don't completely trust him. We had and still have a great relationship so nothing else was affected.",

      "description": "Throwaway cos I’m not sure if my family know my normal account.\n\nBackstory: Me and my brother have a strained relationship atm, he’s a bit younger than me and we just don’t get on that much in general. It all came to a head in the last few days and haven’t really spoken much since.\n\nMy brother has an activity that last for an hour which is about 30 mins away. My dad usually takes him but he is sick with a bad cold. My mom is busy and so they asked me if I would take him. I said I’d rather not because I thought we’d just end up fighting. He coerced me into dropping him off. \n\nSo we go off and the car journey is silent, occasional bits of conversation but nothing much. On my way back my dad asks me if I’ll wait with him and bring him home, I replied I’m already on my way home. Plus my mom had asked if I would get some stuff on my way back. As I get home my dad leaves to pick my brother up.\n\nI feel bad that I sorta made my dad go and get my brother but I had explained to him why I didn’t really want to. Plus I feel like I’m being petty, but at the same time I don’t really want to do things for someone who I’m not getting on with (my brother COULD get public transport if he had to). I should probably head to family problems for advice after this tbh, it’s been going on for a while. :/\n\nSorry for the vagueness but I don’t want to be too specific. AITA?",

The Suv drove around the Caddie figure it was waiting for someone grabbing a coffee.\n\nThe SUV i assumed went into the drive thru so i thought okay ill drive around and get in line. I drove around the car and saw an SUV. Oh! I was right okay nbd. i was positioned poorly because the car was blocking the proper direction i should be in.\n\nNext thing i know the guy in the white car is honking at me guy rolls down his window and starts yelling at me. Typical douche looking white guy with his bangs spiked up. I apologize, and explain to him what was happening. Honest mistake. He’s aggressive and yelling typical hey asshole, yada yada, going on about how he wasnt going into the cross walk i was on(its a cross walk to a dumpster cage in a private parking lot. I frequent this place often its common when theres a line for a car to be there).\n\nHe then yells at me to back up which i did im not a dick if that was his spot its his. Then he doesnt apologize to me he apologizes to the drive through lady for honking while he ordering his stupidly complicated regular coffee. \n\nSo the question is Am i the asshole for driving around him or is he the asshole for going agro on me?

      "description": "Without getting into too many details my brother in law &amp; his girlfriend have lived rent free with us for 2 years. My husband and I have been married for 4 years, together for 8. I lived on and off in our 2 bedroom apartment until last fall because he's military and I had an out of state full scholarship. I recently graduated and moved back permanently. I wasn't aware that they weren't paying the agreed upon rent until recently. We won't go broke because of it, but it will hurt our savings for when he's out of the military next year. They did watch our cat while he was deployed and I was in school. I'm trying to stay as objective as possible with details. \n\nNow the bad stuff:\n\nTheir two dogs have been increasingly aggressive towards people and other animals. The younger one has bitten (drawn blood) my BIL several times when he has to rip the dogs apart from fighting each other (multiple times a week). They waited a very long time to fix him, which is most likely part of the problem. Both of them go after our cats, and one of them attacked a dog on a walk when he got off the leash. They refuse to do anything and tell me I shouldn't get between the cat and dog because they might hurt me, yet tell me the cat can fend for itself.  The dogs also never stop screetching when I am trying to sleep. I averaged 4.5h sleep the whole month of February despite staying in bed for 8-10h (thanks Fitbit). It's not really barking, but this high pitch howling that I can't drowned out with earplugs, two fans, and white noise headphones. When I ask them to keep them quiet so my husband and I can sleep I get childish snarky \"K.\" responses. Furthermore, I found out she's been posting our conversation and trashing me on social media through a mutual friend who didn't think it was right. I'm not that upset as idc about social media, other than it's childish and disrespectful when you live here rent free.\n\nMy things &amp; food keep going missing, getting misused, or getting broken, without any explanation or replacement. I understand things break and stuff happens. I'm very clumsy too, but there have been many items every time I open the cupboards or closets. The most recent was our vacuum is suddenly broken, and I know I didn't do it since I only use it on Sundays. \n\nThe GF has almost burnt down the apartment 2x because she leaves the oven and leaves the apartment! Not on accident, but actually cooking something and thinks it's okay to just goes to the store or take the dogs for a long walk (not out to the bathroom). Luckily I've been around to literally put out the fire. After the first time we made it clear that wasn't okay. The last straw was when I woke up to a smoky apartment again this week!\n\nThere's been a few other things, but these are the major instances. I hate to leave a marriage because I can't stand living here but I see no end in sight and I am literally going insane!\n",

We were having relatively average and first date kind of awkward conversation, when tattoos came up. She has several, two of which are memorial tattoos for a boyfriend who passed away 5 years back. I'd never judge for that, but then she kept talking about him and how great he was. Fine, I guess, but looking back, that was the most passionate she was during the entire date. The way her eyes lit up while talking about him kind of got to me. I'm not jealous by any means, but I feel like this girl has a hole in her heart and that even if we were to have a good relationship, I'd be living it in his shadow. She'll occasionally send me cute pictures of her, which I'm always a fan of, but when I see those tattoos on her arm, I'm just reminded that I will never compare to this dude... At least that's how I feel about it...\nAnyway, am I the asshole for slowly losing interest in her?",

      "description": "After the thousandth petty argument with my roommate, I figured I should bring one of them over here and see what opinions I can get. Warning; extremely petty.\n\nBackstory: I (23M) live with a roommate (23M) in a two-person student apartment. We've known each other since we were kids, and we're currently both studying abroad for our master's courses. We're good friends, but we argue a lot about stupid things, even more so ever since we started living under the same roof.\n\nThe best system that works for us is having a structured system of turns whenever we have to do household chores. I cook one day and he washes up, then he cooks the other day and I wash up. I clean the place one week. He cleans the place the other week. And so on. We try and keep these things clear and agreed upon in advance to avoid arguments.\n\nI have slowly accepted that I have much higher cleaning standards than he does. Every Sunday when it's my turn to clean, I spend 3-5 hours straight and am *somewhat* thorough (or, the word my friend likes to use, \"obsessed\"). When he cleans, he's done in an hour tops. He wipes off some kitchen surfaces, vacuums the fitted carpet, and washes the floors.\n\nAfter he's done cleaning, it's very common for there to be visible oil stains around the walls in the kitchen, bits of food caked onto the counter, soap scum in the drains, pieces of onion/garlic skin scattered in the cupboard or on the floor, pubic hairs around the bathroom floor, facial hair around the bathroom sink, dust on the surfaces he didn't bother to clean, etc etc. All of this gets on my nerves, but he says he doesn't care about it. I'm no cleaning fanatic or anything (in fact, I don't enjoy cleaning at all), but I like the *results* of cleaning and enjoy living in a well-kept place, so I do put effort into it.\n\nEither way, he has different standards of cleanliness and I've come to accept that if I want the place to be clean enough, I'll have to put in 4x the amount of time he does to get it to that state. Everyone has different standards and I can't force him to abide to mine.\n\nNow for the argument. My parents or his parents sometimes come over to visit from our home country and stay on our sofa bed. They generously help us out with the cleaning when they come. Whenever it's my turn to clean and my parents are over, I usually help out with cleaning too, but each time, my roommate insists that I didn't help enough and that it doesn't \"count as a turn\", so I would still need to clean the next week.\n\nLast week, my parents came over again, and I spent around 1h30min helping them clean. I vacuumed, did the bathroom surfaces, washed the floors, and changed the vacuum cleaner bag. Of course, an hour and a half of cleaning is not as long as I usually spend, since my parents helped a lot too. Today comes, and the same thing happens. I tell him he should be cleaning, he says it's still my turn because my parents were over last week to help. I get a little tired of this excuse (or at least, what I perceive to be an excuse) and have a go at him.\n\nHis arguments are \"you didn't do everything by yourself last time, your parents helped you\" and \"you can't just change a system - when parents come over the previous times and helped with cleaning, we never skipped a turn\".\n\nMy main argument is that, despite having help, I still spent more time cleaning last week than he does on average when it's his turn (which he didn't deny). He now refuses to clean, putting me in a position where I have to either clean for this week too or put up with a dirty house for another week. As someone who is genuinely quite tired of having the burden of a lot of the house upkeep being on me and is also busy with other things today, I really don't want to be the one to clean again, so I'm quite annoyed.\n\nTL;DR: My roommate and I have a turn-based weekly cleaning agreement. I have higher cleaning standards than him so I spend around 3-5 times the amount of time he spends cleaning when it's my turn. Last week, my parents came over and helped me with the cleaning. Despite the help, I still spent more time cleaning than he usually does. He still insisted that I didn't do my due for that week since I had help and that I should spend my day cleaning again this week. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Namely birthdays, but some other stuff as well.\n\nLong story short, I was born on NYE and New Year is a fairly big thing in my family. As far as I can remember the only things I'd get for my birthday were a cake and a present with the line \"this is for St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas and your birthday.\" Sometime during middle school I stopped giving a damn about the NYE and NY, and I'd spend most of the time either helping out in the kitchen or playing Diablo 2 (that became some sort of tradition for me).\n\nNote: I'm in mid-20s, living in a family house. Not unusual in my area.\n\nFast forward to some years back. There used to be a bistro nearby which was going to close with Jan 1st. I found out around mid-November. They had this one weekly special which I always wanted to try - there's a large bit of prep time and the taste is never \"right\" if you make it at home. I pitched the idea to celebrate my birthday there to my mom, who thought it was a great idea and we pitched the idea to grandparents. Problem was the last good opportunity to do so was the next day. Anyway, Grandpa was silent, and the Grandma's response was \"We went somewhere yesterday so we don't feel like going anywhere tomorrow. I cooked food for two days. And it's not a good time to waste money. And next week [duties] start, so we won't have the time.\" Later, mom told me grandma was right, that just the two of us will celebrate it at a similar bistro at some future point in time and it was left at that.\n\nThat year, between Christmas and New Year, I simply disappeared right before lunch. No notice or anything. It's something I just don't do. I went to a Chinese restaurant. The context is I've been trying to go with _anyone_ for years, but never did. My friends are either on the other side of the country or spread around the globe, so that leaves my mom who always stalled (for various reasons, some of them financial) until I gave up.\n\nNext year I had a minor thing to celebrate, family tradition. From the start it was stressed as _my_ celebration. I got home one day from work, done surprisingly early, only to be greeted with \"I'm glad you're here! We're celebrating your thing on Sunday with Y, but no one feels like dressing and going there, so we want you to go there, pick up the food to-go and bring it here.\" This was a month after we talked and I explained what and where I wanted to do/have. From everything I heard, I had no reason to think that conversation wasn't forgotten, so I went with my original plan.\n\nThat year's birthday party is what I count as the only birthday celebration I had with my family in the past ~8 years, rather than being present at a party celebrating my birthday (which was always pushed aside for sparkling wine and fireworks). I had to effectively emotionally blackmail everyone involved to get to celebrate how I wanted. No one complained about the food, ambience or anything, only had constructive criticism about some stuff.\n\nAnd then comes the last year, where my mom asked me what I wanted to have for my birthday. I told her X, Y or Z. Her response was \"Those are okay ideas, but I don't like them for this occasion, so I'll make H and D.\" I nodded, helped her search for the recipe she wanted and went to celebrate on my own two weeks later.\n\nEach time except the first, there was a massive argument with my mom. I explained where I went and why I went there. Primary emotion driving me was always anger. In her case, she was always viscerally hurt by me excluding her from my birthday. Pointing out I always felt excluded from _my_ birthday... didn't help.\n\nAfter the last time, she basically swore off ever doing anything for my birthday again - until I deem her worthy of celebrating with me. \n\nSo... am I the asshole? And writing this did feel a bit therapeutic.",

      "description": "So about 6months ago, my BF and I kept fighting about his drinking. He can’t just have one drink or a few beers....he always blacked out. I would then stop drinking to make sure we got home with keys/phones/wallets etc. I would be the one to make sure he didn’t fall asleep on the table- yet I ALWAYS got blamed for “wanting” to leave the bars. He would constantly tell his friends I was the one making him go home...yes, bc of his drinking. The last straw was when he embarrassed me in front of family and friends. He wouldn’t stop drinking when out for a family bday dinner. I told him it was enough, to stop and I was told to “fucking get over it already”. At that point I was done. \n\nHe told me he stopped drinking liquor after that. But he typically returned to hometown without me, due to school/work schedule. Going home is like a trigger-he can’t NOT drink. And he mostly drinks liquor. \n\nWell found out he lied repeatedly about doing shots when home one weekend. I lost my shit, promised to be done with him if he couldn’t stop lying and drinking. It’s been good ever since that long talk. \n\nThen, we go out last weekend. It’s been two months since the long talk. And what does he order at the bar? Liquor. I made a comment, he drank the drink and switched to beer. It was wrong that I just accepted that he had a liquor drink. \n\nA few days later we make plans to return to hometown and the drinking comes up. Y’all, he was pissed- it was only drink he claims! And makes a comment about the bloody Mary’s we had a few weeks ago and I made no comment. (We honestly never go to brunch, and I don’t consider a Bloody Mary to be a “drink” I know it sounds weird but again we have them rarely and it never turns into him being drunk). So all this after less than two months ago I told him to either stop or I’m done. Alcoholism is a huge factor in both our families, and the signs are all there that he’s developing a problem. For context, been together almost four years. This is new behavior from him. But it’s been a problem for long enough that I’m worried. And exhausted. And scared for the future. \n\nBlack outs, lies, excessive drinking, hiding it from me, inability to say no, etc... \n\nSo AITA for asking him to stop drinking, and if he can’t, I walk away? ",

      "title": "AITA for divorcing my wife even though I know we love each other?",
      "description": "# Intro\n\nWe had a long-distance relationship for 2 years. 4 months ago we got married. A month ago we broke up. In 3 days we're getting divorced.\n\nI think I still love her. Or at least I miss her – I think about her every hour, every day.\n\nI believe she still loves me. I know she thinks about us, views our photos, at least sometimes.\n\nThe problem is – I've always loved her more than she loved me. My parents loved us more than she or her mother would allow. This ruined everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part I. Context\n\nMany years ago we dated for a month. We were kids, I didn't know what to do with the whole dating thing, I didn't really need it, so I left her. I didn't have any break-up experience, so I just started ignoring her – stopped answering calls and seeing her. I hurt her.\n\nThrough the years, we moved and settled in different countries. Two years ago I invited her to a concert, she agreed. We met, and then we spent the whole night and day just talking about what had happened a long time ago. I was apologizing, giving excuses, explaining that I was a kid, and I'm a different person now. She was very careful, because she remembered all the pain I caused her previously.\n\nI was convincing her to try and start all over again. I was pulling, she was resisting. I wanted to move forward, she wanted to slow down.  This was the foundation of our relationship.\n\nWhen I said \"I love you\" for the first time (ever, in my whole life), she didn't say it back. For weeks I was telling her that, and for weeks she couldn't say it back, until one day I pushed on her by asking whether she loves me. And this was just one of the things; at some point I had a note where I would write down all the things that felt painful to me – some sort of a mini-diary, just because I didn't want to discuss this with anyone. I didn't have anyone to discuss this with. Basically, it was a list of examples of how I cared for her more than she did for me.\n\nI loved her. She was slowly falling in love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part II. Have Love, Will Travel\n\nAfter some time, things got much better. We got close, really close. I deleted the note, I didn't feel any of those things anymore. We built trust, we were the closest friends. We had the most amazing sex. We would completely understand each other.\n\nGeographically, we were still living in different time zones. We spent hours video-chatting every day, and we saw each other every other weekend – usually I would fly to her, occasionally she would fly to me or we would both fly somewhere. This was a very romantic period: every travel, every hour together, every destination – it was all bringing so much pleasure and excitement.\n\nHowever, I still wanted just a bit more than she did. I wanted to move in together – I was ready, and she wasn't quite yet. I wanted us to spend some time with our parents when we were on holidays in our home country, while she preferred seeing friends. During our weekends together, I wanted to get a feeling of a household – I wanted to cook together, maybe do some housework, while she preferred going out for long walks and dinners.\n\nBut we respected each other. I would try not to push too hard on her, and agreed when she was saying \"it is a bit too soon, isn't it?\". She would try to do some things I wanted us to do, and agreed when I was saying \"it is a right thing to do, isn't it?\". I was slowing myself down, she was pushing herself out from her comfort zone. This helped us stay together, keep the balance, and slowly gravitate towards each other.\n\n10 months ago, we got engaged. We couldn't be happier about it, it meant so much! In addition to all the romantic thoughts and feelings, practically, we got 1 step closer to moving in together: we still lived in different countries, and we needed to get married to get visas and eventually move in.\n\nEverything was perfect, except from one thing. Have you noticed the small \"friends before parents\" thing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part III. Parents\n\n*Her dad*. In her family, her father is an outcast. Her parents don't really live together: her father sometimes stays over at home, but often travel to his parents (who live in a different city). Her mother doesn't talk to her father much, and she herself almost hates her father: she was telling me that her dad hurt her mom many times, was never there for her, and never cared about their daughter.\n\n*Her mom*. She absolutely loves her. She is the only child in the family, so their shared dislike of father made them each other's most important person in the world.\n\n*Her grandparents*. Paternal grandparents were never welcome, for same reasons as father: never cared for their granddaughter enough. They also tried to get into her parents' family's business, and never respected the boundaries. Maternal grandparents, however, are extremely close to her. From what I heard, the maternal grandparents were always there for her mom and dad, but never annoyed them. On her parents' wedding day, the grandfather told them: \"If you need us, just let us know; if not – we won't disturb you\".\n\n*Summary*: Father and grandparents are bad. Mother and grandparents are the best. Independence of the young family is very important and has to be respected.\n\n—————\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My parents*. My family is another end of the spectrum: we're all linked, all dependent, all care for each other. My parents are together for 27 years now, their relationship is built on trust and care for each other, for their parents and their children. We all know what's happening in each other's lives. My parents were always my closest friends and advisors, no matter the subject.\n\nEver since I moved to a different country 3 years ago, I was calling them every single day, 7/365. By the age of 16-ish, I concluded that family is the single most important thing in one's life; family is the sense of life, and without a family, life doesn't make sense. I still think so.\n\n*My grandparents.* Same story: my parents loved and respected my grandparents. There were no secrets, open communication, everybody was sharing love. Only paternal grandmother is still alive, and my dad calls her every single day, 7/365. Every other weekend parents travel to her to a different city to bring her food, since she is too weak to cook.\n\n*Summary*: My family is strong, and is based on communication between everyone.\n\n—————\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the day we met, my parents couldn't wait to see my girlfriend. They wanted to know her, they wanted to spend at least some time with her. They welcomed her in our family, invited her parents multiple times when we were both away from our home country. My parents wanted to unite two families; based on the success of my parents in building their own family, I thought they're right.\n\nSince the day we met, my girlfriend perceived this as pressure. Her parents would find excuses to reject my parents' invitations. She couldn't understand why my parents want so badly to meet her. She defended her right to see her friends instead of my parents whenever we were visiting our home country on short holidays. She said that it's too soon, and there will be time for meeting my parents closer. She wanted my parents to stay cool and keep some distance; based on the intrusiveness of her paternal grandparents into her parents' family life, she thought my parents are wrong.\n\nI took my girlfriend's side. I asked my parents to be cool and let us do whatever we want; they couldn't understand us, but agreed to obey. They were concerned that their future daughter-in-law would avoid them, but kept hoping that things will change over time.\n\nI started building a wall between us and my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part IV. Pots And Pans\n\n*3 months before the wedding.* She and I decided that we'll ask parents to give us money instead of presents for the wedding. I mentioned this to my parents, but never emphasized enough.\n\n*2 months before the wedding.* My parents buy us a set of expensive high-tech kitchenware, and ask us to choose between two sets of silverware. This was a huge blooper: culturally, sharp things are never given as presents – that is considered to bring bad luck. My parents genuinely haven't thought about that, and neither have I.\n\nI bring the news to my girlfriend, she gets super angry: \"Your parents did not respect our request to give money instead of presents, I don't want any of those pots in my house, and now your mom tries to bring a bunch of sharp knifes to our wedding\". While I totally agree with her, I don't like her tone and anger: my parents wished nothing but the best, and they didn't deserve the blame. We stop talking for a day – for the first time in our relationship.\n\nIn the evening she calls me, and asks why I didn't call. \"Remember how you ignored me many years ago? Do you want it all to repeat? ... You don't have the right to be angry at me just because I'm angry at you. ... How could you do this just before our wedding? This wasn't a man's act, and now I don't know how to marry such a man\". On that last phrase she hangs up and switches off the phone.\n\nHysteria. 2 months before the wedding such a small (as I thought) fight turns into an \"I'm not sure how to marry you now\" situation. I'm terrified, I think I can lose her. 9pm, I book a flight to her country. 3am, I'm catching a bus to the airport. 9am, I'm in her city. I came to talk; to be honest, I was hoping that flying to a different country in 12 hours just to talk would show her how much I love her.\n\nHer mom was visiting her that week. This doesn't happen often, and she values every single hour with her mom. So instead of a hug, a kiss, a tear, I get another accusation: I should've respected her time with her mother, and I should not have come.\n\n* One - I didn't protect her from my parents who bought us a present we didn't want.\n* Two - I started the drama by not messag",

      "description": "So for the past 3-4 weeks there has been a third party construction company replacing doors, stairs, and other external pieces of the apartments. \n\nMost of the apartments do not have power outlets outside but mine does and it’s right next to my front door. It’s also on the same circuit as my TV, home server, desktop, and multiple other expensive electronic devices. \n\nThere is also a building that the apartment uses for storage which has power a few doors down from mine. \n\nThe workers plugged their extension cord to my power outlet and ran it to their tools (about a 100 foot extension cord and about 20 different power tools plugged in to it). Connected for about 10 hours per day. \n\nWhen I first saw this I called the apartment and asked if they would be compensating me for the use of my electricity. They said the amount used was negligible. I got upset and hung up. Later that night, they went to unplug the tools and it flipped a breaker. The worker was nice about it and apologized and I asked why they didn’t use the complex’s power instead of mine. They didn’t speak English very well so they didn’t understand the question. \n\nThe next day they plugged in to my outlet again and I went outside and found some of the maintenance staff that is on the apartments team rather than third party and explained the situation to them. They told me that I could contact the office with my complaint. So I did. This time they said they’d pay the difference in my bill compared to last month’s bill. \n\nThe next 2 days were uneventful. Using my power but there was nothing I could do. \n\nThen they plugged in again and my power immediately went out. Went outside angrily and yelled at the workers (both third party and staff were outside at this time) because I had brought this up a few times at this point. They apologized and said they had been drawing power from multiple people not just mine (this is a lie. I walked around the complex looking to see if they were using other peoples power on the first day and saw only mine being used). \n\nThe next morning after this they plugged in to mine again. What do you know the breaker flips and my power goes off (this is now three unplanned power offs of my home server that I use for development and file storage and other uptime-sensitive things)\n\nI called the office once more this time furious asking if they’re going to be replacing all my electronics because this problem has been presented to them and they’ve done nothing about it. They sent the third party company’s project manager to talk to me. He apologized and told me it wouldn’t be a problem if I didn’t have so many devices plugged in to MY POWER THAT IM PAYING FOR). He moved the plug to the one that is paid for by the apartment complex. The workers continued working. It hasn’t been a problem since. ",

      "description": " Am  I the asshole here? So, I have a digital art business, that right now  is used mostly for making twitch setups, emotes, badges, portraits, and  logos. All sorts of stuff. In my spare time, I like to browse twitter  (not fiverr because there's way too many scams and not enough time in  the day) and find people who have 1) stolen emotes 2) traced other  people's emotes or 3) used google images to 'make' emotes and then sell  them.\n\nEnter in someone who has (in my  eyes) clearly used an art program for removing backgrounds (which i  mind), and maybe one for cartoonizing people (which i don't mind) to  make an emote. They have a set of four posted, all of which set off the  \"google images pasted together\" alarm in my head. I make a reply to it,  stating that they google their images for their emotes.  (Again, this is  just something I do, and I haven't been even close to wrong until  today. Don't know whether I'm wrong or not yet, but that's not what this  is about.)\n\nLet me see if I can add in images here. [Here's the emote in question](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/543130282132242432/547216511518113822/unknown.png),  posting the \"proof\" she made it. I said something along the lines of  \"okay, thanks for the proof. It just looks like it was pasted together,  that's all.\"\n\nHer friend's attacking me  constantly since then, saying I'm \"jealous of her art\" though in my  opinion, mine has one clean style throughout and doesn't look like four  people made different parts of the emote. There are apps that remove  backgrounds, apps that remove colors making things transparent, and apps  that basically make putting these together easy as heck so you can just  paste all this together, color it in, and sell it for profit.\n\nAs  someone who draws things from scratch, and is friends with a bunch of  others who also draw from scratch, it sucks to see people cheating the  system and scamming. So, after my post, I've said multiple times that I  saw the proof and it was fine, it only resembled other emotes that are  pasted together. (my opinion is different, but that's what i said to the  person).\n\nAm I the asshole for pointing  out that their art looked like it was pasted together from google and  then acknowledging that their proof showed otherwise? Their friend seems  to think so, with all the messages they've been posting.",

About 2 hours later after I'm leaving the gym my other friend text me stating that I hurt her feelings by saying this and I should watch how I say stuff next time. At this point I'm a little annoyed because the friend I told to slow down has said stuff way worse than \"slow down\" to us guys in the group. I'm talking about saying Little dick, Twink and bunch of other stuff. We have thick skin and just brush it off but as soon as we retaliate she always says she's a sensitive person so we shouldn't be mean. What I'm mad about is how tf does me saying slow down when scoffing down a donut offend you?I have screenshots if you guys would like to see this absurdity.I wanna know what you guys think and want to know if I'm missing something here?\n\nTldr; told my friend to slow down when eating,e friend text me saying I hurt her feelings even though she's say way more hurtful shit",

I told her I decided to do a birth-week thing for fun with my boyfriends boyfriend, and she made a comment saying “Yikes. You’re one of “those” people”. Everything I do or say is “yikes” with a rude comment following it either making me feel like I did something wrong, or shitty. She tends to make me feel stupid, and speaks about me as if I’m just gonna be some druggie whore in the future. I could be overreacting about this, but being talked down to overtime is starting to bother me. \n\nNot only that, but she’s very private about of her life, and I get that some people are like that, but in this situation I just find it weird. When she and I text, she’s always talking about all this cool stuff she does with her friends and how amazing they are. From the things she tells me, it’s like her life is entirely a movie since all these things are always going on.\n\nThey seem cool, yeah. Whenever I ask to meet/talk to them though, she just refuses, makes up some excuse to why I can’t, or completely ignores the question. It doesn’t even need to be specifically about the friend, I’ll just ask to see a drawing her friend made and it’ll be the same thing. Maybe it’s just me, but something always felt weird about that?\n\nIt put me off that she would tell me how I was one of her closest friends, and thought of me as a real life friend, but would keep me excluded from pretty much anything going on in her life, while I included her in things. She’s currently closer friends to my ex-friend (ex-friend for other reasons), meanwhile I don’t know anyone or anything she does. It made me wonder if anything she’s even said was true in the first place, and this whole time I’ve been believing this fake life she’s been portraying. I don’t know if I’m just overthinking things or what.\n\nThese are the more recent things, but she’s done worse, and I don’t think I want to deal with this kind of thing for another two years. She knows a lot of personal things about me (which is my fault for telling her), and I’m afraid she’ll tell my ex-friend, and then have him tell everybody, but I would rather deal with that drama than with her again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She would often out-roast me because she would talk about my mother and sister saying how they are all whores. There was nothing I could do because If I roasted her family I knew she would get upset and try to fight me or something like that, so I just let her roast my family. This would happen everyday in school, and it got to the point where I didn’t want to go to school because of her and everyone would laugh at me because her jokes were funny. So eventually, I just stopped being her friend. She saw this and asked me why I stopped being her friend. I ignored her. Then she said is it because I make fun of your family? I’ll stop. Then. I was relieved but she still continued to do it anyways. She’d even make fun of my dead aunt with her friend and they would both gang up on me. So one day, I just had it. One day in science class she said something about my gf at that time and I lost it. I said fuck you and you’re dead cousin and we ended up arguing. I just kept saying fuck that guy and she would say that my gf sucks dick. We were removed from class and she had wanted to fight like I had predicted. She was also crying.

And I know for a fact the stretching area was empty because it was Saturday at 8 in the morning and 5 people total were lifting. \n\nAfter a while she started yelling at me for \"looking at her\" blabla. I said (maybe not my proudest moment) that being gay (am not but I thought this approach would be smart) I was less interested by her butt but more by the mismatch between her top and her short. \n\nAnd then two guys wanted to fight me for looking at a girl and staring at her butt while she stretches. I am not shaming her etc, but at some point if you wear bright cloths and stretch like this in front of a guy, he is meant to look at some point (and i mean look, not stare). At least for me i was just because something bright was moving in front of me (I am actually diagnosed with a mild autism and this kind of \"flashy stuffs moving\" always attracted me. Bright ones scares the shit out of me tho). And since I knew it was a girl I tried not to stare. But she was directly in front of me and to breath and finish my session correctly I was looking in that direction, not in particular at her. And since I did not have my glasses she was blurry anyway.\n\n\nA coach intervened saying he knew me and my fiancee and there was no way I was staring at her since I am me and I did not have my glasses.\n\n\nThey left and end of the story with them.\n\nAnd when I was home I told the story to my fiancee who agreed with me, but many of my girl friends ( most of them being hardcore feminists) told me I was an asshole for how I handled it. I made her feel conscious of her body and her cloths at the gym, where she was vulnerable. \n\nTo me it was a mooh point and a loose loose situation for me. I should have maybe stopped running on that treadmill and move on an other one. But why should I do that? I was first. Don't want to be looked at don't do that. \nAnd that made me self conscious for being a male (irony here) and autistic (No joke here) because I know I looked despite trying not to. And she was therefore imposing me to fuck up my end of session ( had planed on running 1h30 that day) for her own pleasure. \n\nTo me she chose to come here. And since I was not creeping she had no standing yelling or getting mad. What would be the next step anyway? If a girl enters a mixed jacuzzi or sauna the guys have to leave? \n\nSo... AITA? What could I have done differently? Is there something I missed? \n\n",

      "description": "I'm never good at shorthand titles. So I'll preface this with this: I'm limited contact with most of my family because...well outside of my sister, I pretty much loathe them and hate the fact people tell me I need to keep contact 'because they're family'. I won't get into every detail, but, part of what's relevant to this; my mom used to try egging my brother on to insult me for hours on end and I'm not allowed to do anything and still get called things like \"The incredible sulk\" Simply for being apathetic since any reaction would make it worse and just leaving.  \n\n\nSo, my mother woke me up (I stayed up to 6:00 last night) with a phone call asking since my brother was free today if we'd all like to go dutch and go to Texas Roadhouse for lunch. I don't know why I said yes, but I did. She offered to drive. (bad idea I guess). We go there, everything's fine. For a while.  \n\n\nI don't remember how this conversation started, but my brother ended up saying that the GIF argument is \"Jif\" simply because the owner said it was, I should have kept my mouth shut because I remembered an article someone said that when it comes to acronyms there's two different forms, and I can't remember the terms but one was where you pronounce the entire acronym as an already existing word such as C.A.T. would just be 'cat' and anything else is pronounced in the most similar way to make it most relevant to the words it's abbreviating (so in this case, since Graphic is a hard g it should be 'Ghif' if C.A.T stood for Charlie, it'd be pronounced Chat.) Long explanation but I was simply about to state something to that effect before I get shouted over as I only spoke a few words by my brother, then my mom joins in, and I once again try to speak up only for them both to shout over me.  \n\n\nThen my brother said loud enough a lot of people were turning their heads towards us \"You've been looking it up for 10 minutes! (I wasn't even looking it up at all nor had this even been 5 minutes, but it was just 5 minutes of them yelling back and forth that I was stupid and can't let things go even though after the first two attempts I didn't say a single word.) Just let it go, you're wrong, end of story! It's JIF\" since...ya know, at this point it was my mom and him talking back and forth to egg each other on at my expense.  \n\n\nAS he does this, they finally bring our order to the table, but instead of eating I just walked out, and the only thing I remember hearing my mom say is \"There he goes, overreacting again\" Even though I left quietly.  \n\n\nI know some might view it as an overreaction but I was tired of it, and even then, the food I ordered may have went unpaid for. I don't know. I spent the next 1.5 hours walking home since my mom drove and I didn't want to call an uber.  \n\n\nNobody texted or tried to call me either so I can only assume what was said about me.  \n\n\nSo, did I overreact and am I the asshole for leaving especially since I didn't pay?",

      "description": "I usually tell my SO I am off my period a week after I actually finished bleeding because sometimes I still have some spotting episodes. To just avoid having sex while I'm accidentally bleeding, I just tell him a week later.\n\nOn Monday my SO and I had some plans for some sexy time. We were supposed to go two rounds but after our first round where I gave him oral he ended up falling asleep. No sexy times insued after. \n\nThe same day he acquires a new video game. It's not a problem until I start feeling in the mood but he just won't put the controller down. \n\nI work 6 nights And I am on my feet 100% of the time. I usually get home very exhausted and paired with all the chores I have to do on the daily, I feel like if he would help out a little i wouldn't be so frustrated. \n\nAlso I work nights so I get home fairly early (around 2) in the morning. He is sometimes on it until way after I have fallen asleep and it's morning time. \n\nI have absolutely no problem with it at all, unless we made plans to have sex then yes I would feel annoyed. \n\nLast night, he finally stopped playing his game. And we were watching a movie. In the movie they were making sexual innuendos and he turned and looked at me and said \"what about sex stuff? ;)\" (I think he was being sexually suggestive). \nBut I guess I'm dumb because I can't read cues. And he wasn't being straight up. \nAnd he had already ruined my mood since the beginning of this week. \n\nFast forward to this morning,\nHe asks me how I'm doing and I tell him I'm starting to feel my period pains coming (heavy breasts and hurting lower back). And he said \"I swear you just got off your period. I don't know what's going on with you\"\n\nSo now I feel really bad and targeted. I can't control my body from doing what it's supposed to do. I feel so frustrated and annoyed. I want to cry but somehow I feel like it's just my hormones messing with me. \n\nAITA for not being in the mood or in sync with him when he's ready to have sex?",

Because I don’t want to involve politics, i’ll just say this: If she’s losing a debate, instead of resorting to a normal solution like just sighing and walking away or admitting defeat, she says some bullshit like “You know what? You can shut up.” Or other immature responses. At this point I should probably mention she is in her third year of high school. \nShe is incapable of understanding how to accept a counter argument. For one example, when we were in a debate over text, we have debates often due to us having different political opinions, she provided sources from websites who make up their data, and I showed legitimate and trustworthy websites. At this point, I can’t handle it anymore, I just want to scream and yell at her, the politics are one things, but there’s a slew of other things that I get mad at her for; Lying problem which she hasn’t fixed, not thinking twice, hears what she want to hear, etc. AITA for just not wanting to deal with her BS anymore, even though this may break the trust that we’ve had with each other for over a decade?

      "description": "  \n\nI’m the Best Maid in a wedding tasked with planning the bachelor party. We first discussed a date and threw ideas around about a month ago. At that time the groom was working retail as a manager and said he has a really hard time taking weekends off. As such, we decided to plan the party for a Wednesday to accommodate his needs. Two party members were glad for this decision because they also work retail/service and also have an easier time taking off during the week compared to the weekend. Other party members and friends to be invited work regular Mon-Fri, 9-5 jobs (myself included). Some of them are even coming in from out of state. But we all agreed we could take vacation time to make it work to make sure the groom’s needs were met.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week and a half ago he informs our friend group (in general) that he’s applying for an office job. I halted planning because I knew if he got it he would probably prefer a Saturday over a Wednesday (I also knew he'd probably get it since I used to work there and a mutual friend still does and recommended him). Yesterday he found out he got the job. He’s super excited and relieved to escape retail hell, and I’m super happy for him, too! But this means he now does the M-F, 9-5 grind and that the Wednesday is no longer convenient for him at all. I asked him if he’d like us to move it to a Saturday and he said yes please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I contacted the group to say, “Hey, since the groom’s job situation has changed I think it’s best to move the party date to that Saturday instead.” As a note, this party was planned for 3/20 and I proposed we move it to 3/23 with approval from the groom, AKA, it’s still a month away. No reservations have been made and no money has been put down. Everything is local, relatively inexpensive, and we are not staying at a hotel or renting limos (per the groom’s tastes we’re doing stuff like an old school arcade and stuff).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two party members working retail/service are balking. One of them says she already requested off and there’s no way she can get that Saturday off despite it being a month away, and that we already agreed to a Wednesday. I reiterated that the change is to accommodate the groom and asked if they could at least try to request off. They’re acting like I’m an asshole because I want to change the date based on the groom’s new circumstances. I even offered to try to move the date to a later weekend but they aren’t budging. They think we should go forward with the Wednesday. I don’t want my friends’ party to only have half his wedding party but I also don’t see how it’s fair to make the groom use 2 out of his 5 vacation days for his own bachelor party when he’ll need those days for more important things. Especially when he has weekends off at no cost of PTO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I could fill this with background story on our relationship and stuff but I'll cut to the major points and question.\n\nI haven't been on a holiday in 2 years, between work and life i just haven't had an enjoyable time away from work for longer than 3 day weekends or being sick.\n\nThis year i wanted to take a vacation and my girlfriend and i had been discussing going to Florida to stay at my family's home. I booked off feb 14&amp;15, due to the 18th being a holiday this would give us a good amount of time. The cost of a round trip flight each is $700. Expensive i get that. Ive looked at all inclusives in cuba as well as they are only $300 more.\n\nThis past week we have been fighting a lot, not about the trip but things with our relationship and because of this she isn't sure she wants to go on a trip. I told her i'm going in a vacation whether she wants to come or not. Im not doing a staycation and doing nothing. I offered to pay all of the trip aside from $500 of it because thats her budget and i can respect i make more than her.\n\nAITA if i end up going on this vacation without her?",

      "description": "Background: I bought a ticket to a dance before I decided I would be going with someone. This person had an extra ticket and said I was welcome to have it, so my other friend said she would buy my ticket from me. We virtually “exchanged” tickets (we didn’t have physical copies of the tickets, so we just let the person collecting the money know that my ticket should go to her), and my friend didn’t have cash on her so I told her not to worry about paying me back this instant. \n\nThe next day, I Venmo requested her the cost of the ticket even though I had no intention of having her pay it back right then and there, it was just one more thing to check off my to-do list. She accepted it and paid me but we didn’t really speak about in person. I have a tendency to overthink even the most minute things, so I asked my boyfriend about it and he said I should’ve given her more time to pay me and I might’ve come off as a little greedy/untrusting (especially since my friend is the most kindhearted person I know). \n\nIt’s been several weeks now, but I can’t stop thinking about how she might’ve perceived it. We’re good friends but if I stepped out of line by requesting the money she would never let me know, so here I am. \n\nAITA for requesting the money so soon and so abruptly? \n\nTL;DR: I requested money from a friend only a day after she said she would pay me back and am worried I came off as greedy.

      "description": "I've known this girl and her family for about 2, 3 years now. I was in a very dark place mentally when we first met, so I was glad to have made a new friend. When I went to her residence the first time, a trailer, I was shocked. I don't consider myself a neat freak AT ALL, but this place was in absolute filth. I guess a way to describe it would be... Hoarders (the TV show) Lite. A few months after we met she ended up getting a new puppy, and she basically let the puppy shit in her 7-year-old daughter's bathroom. \n\nA year later they moved into a new apartment. They invited me over a week after they moved. I figured, new place, maybe it'll be pretty clean. Lol nope. I dreaded having to use the restroom while hanging out there. Could barely sit on the couch without sitting on some clothes, or random stuffed toys, etc. \n\nShe sits at home most of the day. \n\nWhat makes me feel bad is... I know she has depression, and anxiety. She takes a lot of medications. One of the reasons we bonded initially was that we could relate to each others' struggles. She also states she has fibromyalgia, and has for years tried and failed to get disability for it. \n\nI've read that there can be a connection between depression and hoarder tendencies. \n\nUntil a few months ago she wasn't working, and I work a full-time job. More often than not she would invite me to come hang out and then ask if I could \"please get some beers, been really stressed...\" This eventually began to turn me off because she would talk about how poor they are all the time and could hardly get groceries or struggled to pay bills on time, but she always managed to get beer and cigarettes. There was apparently no money, but she was always buying random crap off the Wish app. She would talk about how much weight she'd gained, but she really didn't eat much, she just drank at least one 6-pack beer almost every day. My way of thinking was, if someone needed assistance, I'd gladly get some groceries for them, but I don't want to use my money on non-necessities. It made me feel like she thought I had money to just throw around. \n\nSorry if this post is all over the place. I really needed to vent somewhere. I've been trying to cut out toxic things, friendships, etc, that drag me down.  Are these shallow reasons for not wanting to be someone's friend? AITA? ",

      "description": "Backstory: I dated a girl (X) long distance a few years ago and I guess you could say that she was my first love. Well things didn’t work out, but we decided to stay friends. We were still very close to the point where I ended up buying a plane ticket to go visit her over the summer. \n\nNow, some time during the school year before this supposed summer, I ended up dating one of my closest friends (Brandon). I had told him that I was bisexual and had dated a girl prior to dating him. I told him that I was still friends with her and that I actually bought tickets to go see her during the summer before he and I even got together.\n\nA few months later, the night before my departure, Brandon asked to meet so I did. He drove over and we sat in his car and talked. Understandably so, he was worried that I was visiting my ex. I knew I was completely over her as it had been a long time since we broke up and remained friends. The relationship I had with Brandon was going steady as well. I tried my best to reassure him the same. I didn’t think not going was an option since I could not receive a refund on this $400-500 ticket. After a while, it seemed like he was okay with it though. \n\nSo the next day, I’m flying over. It was a short flight and by the time I got to the new state, it was already about 10pm. I texted him that I landed safely and that X was picking me up. I got picked up and we drove to her house and at this point, we both just knocked out. \n\nI woke up the next day and checked my phone. There was a whole series of worried texts such as:\n\n“Hey where are you? What are you doing? Hello? Why aren’t you responding? Is everything okay?”\n\nI texted back explaining how everything was okay and how we just fell asleep once we got home. He seemed relieved. So that was that.\n\nX had an itinerary planned for the entire trip. I usually have my phone on silent and I didn’t check my phone that often because well, I wanted to enjoy this trip (my first time being in a different state). Every couple of hours, I would check my phone and find a series of similar texts as mentioned above. He was worried that something might happen between me and X despite our long talk the night before departure. I understood where he was coming from because X was my ex... but she was my ex for a reason. \n\nThis happened for another 2-3 days. By then, I was fed up by his lack of trust and how I felt like I had to waste my trip constantly consoling him so I essentially told Brandon that I didn’t think this was going to work out. He stopped texting me.\n\nThat night, two of our mutual friends called me saying “what happened?” and I just responded “what?” Turns out, Brandon had blocked me and made a passive aggressive post on FB which everyone obviously knew was about me. He ended up not talking to me, despite having the same friend group, for probably half a year.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m a long-time lurker, I just made this throwaway account not too long ago. \n\nLast night, my parents informed me that we’ll have to be putting my dog down this weekend. I felt like my whole world collapsed from under my feet, even though I knew this was coming. I’ve known him for longer than I can remember; he is 13 years old and has had a great life. I’m comforted by the fact that he’ll pass away peacefully.  \n\nHolding in all of my emotions from people really didn’t feel too good after a while, so I decided to tell my SO (we’ll call her Alex) about it. I prefaced this confrontation by requesting that she ONLY keeps this information between us, as I wasn’t ready to tell anyone else. She was supportive of this, and she helped comfort me. We talked for a while until I went to bed for the night, I felt a lot better. \n\nFast-forward to this evening (4 hours before this post was made). Alex and I are talking on the phone about a project that we were assigned in school, and out of the blue, she mentions:\n\n“I know you told me not to tell anyone (about the news), but I told a friend of mine. And I’m really sorry but I needed a shoulder to cry on”. \n\nNormally, I’d be fine if she sought out support from her friends if something’s troubling her. I’m her SO but I’m not a miracle worker, there are certain times when bros need some bro love and girls need support from other girls. I get that. \n\nI just thought that this kind of topic would be an exception to that rule; an exception that means “I REALLY don’t want you to tell anyone about this. I’m telling you this because I am 100% confident that you’ll keep it between us”. I’ve told her before that honesty and trust are the two traits I value most in a relationship. \n\nI feel betrayed, and I’m really on the fence about wether or not I should mention that I could support her as she did for me, because I don’t want to come off as one of those assholes that tells their SO “I was ALWAYS here for you. Are you telling me that you’re putting your friends over your SO??”.\n\nCurrently, she’s admitted that she’s made a mistake but the confrontation, wether she’s trying to change it or not, is slowly steering toward a situation where she’ll only feel better if I tell her that it’s okay and I forgive her. I’m not going to lie to her, I don’t really think that what she did was okay in this situation. \n\nIt’s not even that I don’t want other people to know, I’ve come to my bearings enough to be okay with that. It’s the fact that she betrayed my trust behind my back, and that I don’t know if I can tell these things to the one person I thought I could come to anymore. Heck, if she had asked me beforehand, I probably would’ve been fine with it. \n\nHelp me out here, AITA?",

His car is covered with little fonts and scratches and he claims none of them are his doing.\nI, and my family have had the conversation with him around perhaps it’s tome to give it up but his ego and need for control has always been a massive part of his DNA, and he absolutely refuses to enter the discussion and is adamant he is not a danger on the roads.\nI bit the bullet and did a self report to the DMV which means he will get a letter to retest for his license within the next 10 days. He is going to go absolutely ballistic but all I can think is the advise I read on a forum one day:\n“Would you trust him driving your kids around? If the answers no then he should be driving”.\n\nShit is about to hit the fan once this letter arrives, and to further exacerbate the guilt I feel - mum is gonna bare the brunt of it as she is always his go to when things don’t go his way.\n\nFuk.",

      "description": "For context, we are in a UK university.\n\nMy friend (and housemate) had a 2 year relationship with a girl from home that ended in his first year of university, because she was a year younger than him. Their relationship always seemed a bit contentious and somewhat immature, but 2 years is a long time at our age. \n\nCome second year in university, she now coincidentally (not sure if him being here influenced her) goes to our same university. They spend a lot of time together during the first few weeks. At that point it is my understanding that they briefly got back together, but that then falls through. Mean things are said, and the breakup isn't clean. \n\nMy friend is really defensive about our sports team, and has said he considers it his family. After the breakup he commanded her to stay away from the team, and the areas we usually hang out. I disagreed with this demand, because I believe that she has every right to fuck whoever she wants, even if he happens to be in our sports team. I tell him this, but anything that goes against his ironclad will was ignored and he would get very angry, despite having asked for my advice. \n\nCut forward to maybe a month into the year, I'm told by her on a night out, after she has an emotional outpouring and I give her some advice, that she fucked a guy on our sports team, and that my mate doesn't know about it.\n\nI didn't tell my friend, because I knew it would cause irreparable damage to his friendship with the team, and because of his anger and emotional issues that I know he has. I also fundamentally disagree with the way he tried and still tries to control her behaviour even though they are no longer together. Personally, I believe he had no right to know about her activities. \n\nThere was a short period of time where it seemed like they might get back together in January, despite mine and my housemates advice to the contrary. For a week they were back together, but it was clear they would fail, because the dynamic was the same as before, and nothing had changed. \n\nCome second semester, news gets around about everything and I still pretend that I have no idea. He now hates the other guy, whom he constantly talks about fighting and intimidating, and he has sent the girl threatening messages, and only now is ignoring her, after finally listening to my advice.  I even had to frase it as 'ignoring her to get back at her' when it's really just for his own sake. I've also had to talk him out of hurling insults at her so many times. \n\nSo, AITA, I reckon it's a ESH. But I don't feel guilty for not telling him, especially after he has acted how I predicted he would. But he has mentioned that just knowing about it and not saying anything would be a friendship dealbreaker. \n\n\n\n",

I know we’re young and it’s a pretty new relationship, but I can really see myself with him forever. Stupid teen thoughts, maybe. But I genuinely do love him.\n\nHis mum is lovely. She’s invited me to go on a family holiday with them to Vietnam. Holy shitballs, batman! Of course I wanna go, I’ve always wanted to go to Vietnam.\n\nMy boyfriend hates travelling. He said to his mum “I don’t really want to go, so I’d  guess Unneuf doesn’t want to go without me.”\n\nPoof, dream crushed. I said alright and went on my merry way, but seriously. I wanna go. This is a trip I’ve always wanted, and what could possibly be better than spending it with the guy I love? \n\nI said as much to him. He said “We could always go in the future.” \n\nI told him “Your parents are paying for us both this time. We may not get an opportunity like this again, and if we do go in the future it’ll be out of our own money.”\n\nHis parents, lovely as they are, said they’d pay for me to go. I’m not having that, me and my family will pay for it. They’ve done so much for me already.\n\nStill my boyfriend said no.\n\nSo I got sad. Not angry at him, just kinda sad. Aaand he felt guilty.\n\n“No, if you don’t wanna go then we won’t.” I said to him.\n\n“You’re making me feel guilty,” he said back.\n\nI did guilt trip him, to be fair. He eventually agreed to it, because he felt so guilty about how upset I was.\n\nAnd then I felt guilty. So I started crying. And then he got upset seeing me upset. So he started crying.\n\nHe says he’s fine with it, but the way I guilt tripped him left a bad taste in my mouth. I wished I hadn’t done it as sone as I did.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriends parents are offering to take us to Vietnam. I wanted to go, he didn’t, I guilt tripped him into saying yes.",

      "title": "AITA For telling my friend his girlfriend was cheating on him?",
      "description": "This happened a few months ago, and as much as I think I done the right thing I have been completely torn about whether or not I was an asshole based on the aftermath of the situation.  Sorry this is really long, just want to make everything as clear as possible since this has been tugging on my conscience for a while.  \n\n\nSo some background. I'm 23 and have been really good friends with this guy, let's call him Bob, (23) for ten years (used to be best friends for 7 years of this). We stopped hanging out when this club we used to go to, where I met him, closed down but still met up occasionally until recently for catch-ups and gigs and spoke to each other a lot on facebook. When we went to this club, we were the only people there that used to listen to heavier stuff like death metal rather than the standard music that played there and so everyone and their mum used to say we should get together for years and years. We did drunkenly kiss when when we were 15 and again at 20  we went to a gig but both times we were very much like, nope, not doing it for me and carried on as good friends and like normal. When we were 19, he had his first relationship which ended when she cheated on him with and left him for his one of our mutual friends. He was devastated, swore off relationships, essentially typical first heartbreak stuff, got over it and was happy being single. A year ago, he bumped into this girl, let's call her Janet, who went to the same club we used to go to. She was 3/4 years younger than us. I didn't know her that well other than through mutual friends and her going to the same place. Think I had made 2 conversations with her at most, and I didn't really like the impression she gave off, which was the stereotypical \"Rawr XD\", \"Look how edgy I am, my music scares people!\" for lack of a better description. They start dating. He introduces me to her and she's immediately pissed off that I didn't know who she was. As I said, I had 2 conversations at most with her years ago. Next time I met her she was very rude and annoyed that I was hanging out with Bob, until Bob told me that he told Janet that he had kissed me twice before years ago but it meant nothing. Bob stopped hanging out with me but we still talked regularly on facebook, commenting on each other's statuses and what not and every time we bumped into each other Janet is incredibly rude to me, even when me and my boyfriend of 2 years have bumped into her alone. Fast forward to a few months ago.  \n\n\nMy boyfriend and I are on a night out to a nightclub Janet regularly goes to. Sidenote: Bob never goes on nights out, ever. We genuinely avoid her every time she's there because she can be really annoying by bragging about how much she's had to drink, how some guy's hit on her, gets weirdly flirty with my boyfriend or some crap like that, but I've always tolerated it because Bob is a good friend and  makes him happy. At about half through the night, my boyfriend and I go out to the smoker's area for a cig, and bam, there's Janet feeling up and making out with one of mine and Bob's mutual friends. I'll admit, I didn't think at all but I tapped her on the shoulder and asked, \"Why are you cheating on Bob?\". They stopped and Janet with a look of horror on her face, says \"What?\" and I asked her the same question again. I then asked the mutual friend why he was making out with her when he knows she's dating Bob. Janet's drunken friend who I've never met but somehow knows me, presumably from Janet probably lying about me having interest in Bob, then says \"She's not cheating! They're playing truth or dare!\" My partner, behind me, says \"That's still cheating.\" I say, \"Whatever\" and go to the other side of the smoker's cage. I was really angry that she could hurt my friend like that, and at the mutual friend for not giving a damn. Janet then runs off inside because she got caught. I asked my partner if I should tell Bob and he said I should, since he deserves to know the truth and that he'll back me up since he saw it to. I open the Bob's chat on messenger when suddenly Janet's drunken friend comes up and starts screaming at me, and grabbing my jacket, saying \"She was just snogging him! It's not like she was fucking him.\" Over and over again. I kept telling her to leave me alone, as did my partner and people overhearing in the smoker's area, trying to split it up. Then she started threatening  me as well as repeating what she previously said, so I pressed record on my phone as soon as. I got everything on video, as it would be proof that she was the aggressor and threatening me if security got involved, and proof to Bob that Janet was cheating. She then caught on she was on video and stormed back inside the building. Because it was on Bob's chat at the time, the video got sent straight to Bob, who asked me to call him. So I did, and he asked me what was happening, why was \\*Janet's friend\\* saying that Janet kissing our mutual friend not cheating, and asking for clarity, so I told him everything that just happened. Bob gets really sad and says that he has to go and will talk later.\n\n I was really upset, from being grabbed (I wasn't going to initiate a fight over something so stupid, whilst I'm sober and they're drunk for one) and for my friend being stabbed in the back so my bf and I had another few cigarettes so I could chill for a bit. About half an hour later, a bouncer comes up to us (she's my mate's aunty) asking why a girl just came up to her in tears over me recording her without her permission.  I responded by saying that the girl was threatening me and physically grabbed me and that I had deleted the video as soon as the girl left. I lied about deleting the video because I couldn't delete the video as it was sent directly on messenger and I didn't want to be in trouble. She checked my phone and nothing there so that was the end of it. I don't get why I was in the wrong by videoing since you don't need permission to film someone in the country I'm in and she was threatening me, but whatever. They left anyway.   \n\n\nThe next day I didn't hear back from Bob and noticed that Janet had blocked me on facebook (never had her as a friend). Bob kept making posts about her, and was still listed in a relationship so they stayed together. Since that night Bob has only spoke to me a couple of times since, but not like in personal chat or anything, just the odd comment on a facebook post, not malicious or out of character or anything, but that's the most interaction with him these days.  I have since found out from mutual friends through her telling  that wasn't the first time she had cheated, but the first time she got caught and that she has been bad-mouthing me to everyone she knows saying that I lied and tried to split them up because I have feelings for Bob, which is really not true. I've been assured by my partner that I did the right thing, but re-playing the situation in my head, I feel like I was in the wrong for telling him, since he had been happy for the year he had been dating her, unaware of her behaviour, but happy nonetheless and because I feel like we've ruined our friendship, even if it hadn't been that great the past year, or that if I was going to tell him, I could have done it in a more sensitive way than sending a video of her friend violently screaming that his girlfriend groping and making out with another guy wasn't cheating because it was truth or dare. All of that has me coming to the conclusion that I didn't do the right thing. Am I the asshole in this situation?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Obviously it's not as simple as that.\n\nAfter school gets out (I'm in highschool) I wait by the bus stop as my ride home. Up until today I hadn't had any problems with other people even though some of them were incredibly young to start smoking and vaping (that's important later). Today I saw this middle schooler let's say around 14 give or take a bit because I had never seen her on campus however there's a second school on this block, which is a middle school. So as I'm sitting on the bench I completely minding my own business her and 3 other friends pick up a cigarette off the ground which still had most of it's actual white left. Then light it and walk around to the back of the bench and start vaping (with a juul) and smoking the falling apart cigarette. After they do this I start staring. And she immediately screams at me asking me what the fuck I was looking at, and I could immediately tell that she was one of those people. I acted like it took me a second to realise she was talking to me and i took my earbuds out then asked her what she had said. She repeats herself and completely skips all negotiation and before I can get a word in she asks if I had problem with her and to \"do something!\" And with no time for even a breath continues with \"hit me!\" As if they were in the same sentences. I asked her \"why would I hurt you?\" Then she interrupts me by just screaming in my face. I told her that she was already hurting herself as I am very aware of how drugs can ruin someone. Then she rips the juul out of her friends hand and asks me: \"does this make you feel uncomfortable?\" (Keep in mind I've been very nice and calm to her and smiled the whole time.) Then she basically blew this disgustingly sweet juul vapor into my face and I just closed my eyes, then she does it again. Everyone started joining in after she left by just making fun of me and just insulting my appearance overall, but the only one that really bothered me was that someone said that I probably hadn't showered in a couple years because my hair looked greasy. After a while she circled back around yo the stop my mother had pulled into the driveway and she yelled at me with something  So Reddit, am I the asshole for staring at and judging her for her bad habits as well as commenting about them?",

      "description": "I live in an apartment building split into 3 floors. On the bottom floor live my neighbors, 2 women in their early 60’s, who take no care of their health.\n This may sound judgey, but they are both very obese, both smoke, and it’s a routine thing that they are bringing home large amounts of greasy junk food that makes the building smell, and they have mobility issues due to their weight. \n Until recently, I couldn’t care less because it’s their life and more power to them, however in the last month, we have had the fire department here 11 times. They have been calling the fire department to help one of them get up the first level of stairs to their apartment. \n This causes several issues for me, one is that I live on the second floor, and when this is going on, I literally cannot leave my place as the stairwell is full of firefighters and sometimes equipment. \n Another is that a fire truck blocks the street where I park, meaning I’ve been late to work 4 times this month because I can’t move my car because I have to wait for the fire truck to move.\n Finally, what kinda personally irks me is that I feel like people with real emergencies are unable to get help because this person keeps calling the emergency services and using them like a carer or a health worker. \n So last week I was heading out to work and as I put my hand on the door to leave, here comes 3 firefighters and my neighbor, so being decent, I hold the door open so she can get inside. \n First thing she does is bark at me “Your ass is going to have to wait” which was super uncalled for, I’ve never been anything other than helpful when I can be, and I was already pissed that once again I’m going to struggle to get to work on time and so I snapped and said “Well at least peoples houses aren’t burning down because I can’t stop eating fried chicken”\n She went off and yelled until she couldn’t breathe, so the firefighters had to virtually dead lift her up the last few stairs. \n After a chat with the Mrs, it seems kinda 50/50 on if I was an asshole or it was justified. So I submit it to you, Reddit. \nWas I the asshole?",

      "description": "I live in uptown Denver but often walk around downtown. I sold my car once I moved to the city because public transit was cheaper and I just like walking. \n\nAnyway, this was about a month ago. I had gotten off work and got downtown at about 10:30. I'm 21F and I walk alone, often in the dark because I have to for work. I carry pepper spray and I fast walk everywhere. This night was one of those that the temperature was in the negatives, the roads and sidewalks were icy, and the wind was blowing so hard I couldn't feel my face.\n\nI was walking along Colfax where I had been dropped off. Usually I just go straight home, but that night I was going to Argonaut for a bottle of whiskey. This meant I needed to cross Colfax at some point, and being me I chose the first intersection off the bus to cross at. For those of you who are curious/know Denver, it was Colfax &amp; Broadway, so...always busy.\n\nFirst I crossed Broadway because that signal was already in my favor. I faced to cross Colfax, one-way traffic facing me from the left. I watched as their light turned yellow, and took a premature step. The second their light was red, I was on the crosswalk.\n\nImportant to note, the lights at this intersection work fast, and essentially the second their light turned red, my pedestrian signal came on. I know this not only because I saw it with my eyes but also because I cross there a lot.\n\nSuddenly, I'm startled out of my wits because the first car I had stepped out in front of was BLARING their horn at me. Instinctually, I hopped back. They pulled up onto the crosswalk.\n\nI felt I wasn't doing anything wrong (the pedestrian signal was on), so I flipped off the car's tinted windows and walked around the back of it.\n\nThis bitch opens her car door and starts SCREAMING obscenities at me. \"BITCH, YOU TRYIN' TO GET RAN OVER?\"\n\nI said, \"Dumbass, you trying to run people over?\"\n\nI learned quickly that, unbeknownst to me, this person had really, REALLY wanted to turn right on red just before perpendicular traffic had begun accelerating, but unfortunately couldn't because this BITCH of a PEDESTRIAN was in the crosswalk! \n\nI didn't figure that before she honked and yelled it at me because guess what, she wasn't even signaling that intention.\n\nShe was stepping out of her car. I was annoyed and feeling confrontational for once, but the wind was hurting both my skin and my life force, so I kept walking. I kept my middle finger up at her as she continued to scream, \"STUPID BITCH! YOU'RE A DUMBASS BITCH YOU KNOW THAT? YOU KNOW THAT? YOU'RE FUCKING STUPID!\"\n\nI don't really understand trying to fight someone in the freezing cold, late at night in the dark, who was a female by herself, at the risk of holding up traffic.\n\nI'm *pretty fucking sure* the pedestrian signal being on is the most legal way for me to cross. But the way this lady was losing her absolute shit at me made me think maybe I was wrong somewhere? Somehow? \n\nWhat do you think? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So every winter me and my family usually goes to our cabin in the mountains, where we hang out and generally have a good time. As i am not a kid anymore (18), it isn’t always as fun as it used to be. \n\nEspecially when most of my friends will stay at home, and have empty houses where we can do stuff that 18 year old boys normally do. \n\nAs i said, i have known about the trip to the cabin for some time now, and i only realised a couple of days ago what my friends were going to do (they hadn’t talked about it much infront of me because they knew i was supposed to be away with my family). \n\nSo i decided to try to convince my family into letting me stay at home, alone. Slightly pressured into it by my friends. And after a long discussion, they allowed me to stay at home. \n\nThe problem is that i could clearly see my family, especially mom, was upset. They tried doing everything they could to make sure i would join them. For instance activities which i like and they really dislike, and also buying stuff for me. They tried doing so much to make me go with them, but i refused to negotiate, and didn’t back out.\n\nI know that i will have more fun with my friends, but i feel like such an asshole for letting down my family, when they clearly wanted me to join them so much.\n\nMy family leaves in 14 hours, and i’ve still got time to change my mind. I’ve also avoided telling my friends about the whole situation, and they still think i’m going with my family. So i’ve still got both paths open.\n\nSo AITA? And what should i do?\n\n",

I said because I never buy anything. jake said I was stingy. chris asked for me to buy the game. I said no because I'm saving up for a phone. I didn't have a phone. chris got super pissed at me and said I was making up excuses. this goes on for a while and I'm trying to be nice until I just said \"Chris. I don't know you\" jake posted a picture of the kick user button. \"think about what you say before you say it\" for the record. I did. it seemed like the right choice. I said \"sorry I don't wanna spend my money,\" Chris said \"that's all you needed to say\" and then they had a conversation with 2 people alone in a group chat with 5 people. I said it was cluttering and they should move to dms. jake often complains about me doing that.  jake then said \"its not a conversation so its fine.\" AITA? keep in mind jake is 14. I'm 13. and idk how old Chris is.",

      "description": "I feel like this is very trivial, and probably shouldn't be asked on this subreddit, so I will try to make this short:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first asked if i wanted to hangout with her, and I replied with a yes. So I went over, and we decide to watch movies.  The movies she picks out are two movies I've never heard of before or even seen, so I thought that was great. However, these  two movies are ones she has claim to seen multiple of times before, meaning she probably knows the plot, all the jokes, etc. In my mind i think to myself,  if she already seen it, she probably will be bored of watching it. So I try to make small talk here in there, mostly things that were about in the movie. Not a lot to be a distraction, but just enough to atleast have something there. I would notice in the beginning though that was pulling out her phone, and texting people, so i assume she just quickly replying to people before watching. But every time I went and glance at her, she would still have her phone up. Sometimes not even texting people but just browsing Facebook or Instagram.  This lasted for both movies. At that point it made me feel uncomfortable and uneasy, as it was already hard of enough to make conversation with how shy i am, but also felt like i was unwanted in the moment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I text them, and try to give a small complaint about the phone (There was other things that night that bothered me, but I'm gonna try to keep it to the phone mostly), saying like maybe we should watch a movie we both haven't seen so we can try to both pay attention to the movie, or something else. But now they seem to be sort of mad in that they shouldn't have invited me over if i was going to make a big ordeal about them using their phone. Am I the AITA for maybe complaining about them using their phone when we are watching a movie?",

I’m not perfect, but I can safely say I am extra careful with what I do and say around my kiddo. Parenting her has also taught me to not judge other parents, with an exception.\n\nMy old next door neighbor has a one year old, and she is literally posting on Facebook about her injuries daily. She’s already glued to her phone as it is. Within a two week timespan, she had mentioned how she fell head-first out of a shopping cart at Walmart and was being monitored for a concussion, fell off of their brick fireplace, fell out of a high chair, got into their closed tub and turned the tap on to almost knee depth before being discovered, had symptoms that ended up progressing to pneumonia due to not going to a doctor sooner because signing the kid up for baby gymnastics and attending two classes was more important, and fucking ate chunks of drywall out of the house they just bought. Tons of other incidents before that, constant bruises on her head and face. I know kids can be little tornados of wtf, but her constant posting of pictures and ‘look what she did now!’ blasé approach to it actually started to piss me off. Many of these incidents could have been avoided if she paid more attention. The irony is that she seems to think choosing IVF makes her the best mother alive and her relationship with God pretty much places her above everyone (she’s fiercely Pentecostal and openly condemns same-sex couples we know and all that). Her husband is currently deployed and I know he sees this, and probably doesn’t need the added stress of seeing his kid always getting hurt.\n\nTo add, my husband is also friends with her on social media and has brought this up on his own accord, and he typically doesn’t give a rat’s ass about anyone’s business. Hearing even him go, “damn, again?” says a lot.\n\nAnywho, after the umpteenth clusterfuck that made its way to social media, I had commented on how her baby seems to be getting hurt quite a bit, and she flew off the handle. She made at least three passive aggressive posts after that saying how ‘people are too nosy’ and how ‘the world is godless and needs help’ (I am openly agnostic) yada yada. I cut ties with her since, but can’t help wondering if mentioning concern was out of line.",

      "description": "A little backstory first. \n\nI am a (19 m) manager at a movie theater in which we have an arcade. \n\nThe employee in question is (19 f), we will call her E, and is the SO to a previous assistant manager that I am still friends with. (He was promoted and now works at a different theater in the city and has the same job title as me). \n\nThe arcade in question is one that awards tickets for games played, which can be used to redeem for prizes. One of these prizes is a metal lunchbox tin with some design on it (starwars or pac-man etc.)\n\nDuring some downtime, I was in the lobby and was on my phone. E approached me with immediate frustration and cussing. \n\n\"What is this about me stealing a fucking lunchbox from the arcade!?\" E exclaimed\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I questioned calmly\n\n\"I'm getting real sick and tired of this bullshit!\" she then walked off without letting me interject\n\nIt's important to note that I cannot recall exactly what she said, but she was raising her voice and cussing 100%, it could be considered yelling but it depends on how one would define yelling. I however stayed 100% calm like a good manager does when dealing with his employees. \n\nIt is also important to not that I 100% had no idea what the fuck she was talking about\n\nI then think to myself \"that was odd\", before heading to the office to see if any of my fellow managers had any answers for me. \n\nTurns out that the count for the lunch boxes were off and a fellow manager was investigating this matter without informing me at all (let alone telling me that they were going to be talking to E). This is important because E has been know to be very reactive when it comes to pretty much anything (rude guests, you name it). The problem is that her SO normally was there to calm her down, or at least take a little responsibility for these situations. With him being promoted, I wasn't going to approach her and tell her to control her emotions or anything because that would be super rude. this led to me pretty much ignoring her occasional outbreaks when it came to other employees or guests (if nobody complained to me about her I didn't want to poke the bear). this time was different because it was me she was raising her voice at. \n\nI'll admit, the co-manager in question was not the sharpest tool in the shed when it came to handling this situation. She knew that E had overactive tendencies. She then asked E if she knew anything about the missing lunchbox. (In a conversation afterwards, the manager made it clear to me she wasn't accusing her at all and was just genuinely asking.) She obviously failed to see how E would actually take the conversation, i suspect the manager was understating how accusatory she was being. After this conversation was over E then approached me. \n\nThe other manager was known for being disliked by the employees for various reasons. So it makes sense that she came to me to voice her displeasure about the situation, which is totally fine. I just felt like I was used a bit like a punching bag here. \n\nAfterward the manager figured out that the whole situation was a misunderstanding and that the lunchbox never went missing and everything was fine. \n\nI then told the manager very politely that i didn't like being kept out of the loop considering I had just been yelled at, and that we both knew how E would react to the conversation, she said my bad, good enough for me.\n\nnow normally i would have just let this go and chock it up to being another one of E's outbreaks, but i felt pretty attacked so I wanted to do something about it. I am normally very passive about these kinds of things.\n\nI was chatting with some of my work buddies and E joined in the conversation (all mutual friends), shortly afterward I steered the conversation toward the recent situation and said that i didn't like being yelled at, she said that she wasn't yelling, to which I said that regardless I didn't like the way i was treated, and that if she ever has a concern to just ask me instead of cussing etc, I am reasonable. She then raised her voice again and said \"fine, I guess if there is ever a problem I just won't say anything then!\" then stormed off. important to note that again, I was very calm throughout this brief interaction. \n\nI was pretty pissed but didn't push anything further and I haven't talked to her since.\n\nI feel bad for E because she isn't a super happy camper, she has stated her displeasure with her employment among other things. (this was back when we were friends and texted regularly). But i can't help but feel I was wronged regardless. It doesn't help that she is dating a friend which I feel makes the situation a little tricky to navigate. As I don't want workplace situations to affect the friendship. (the main reason for not saying anything in previous outbursts)\n\nI am also a little upset at the manager who screwed the pooch with this whole situation, she is known for not thinking things through and messing stuff up even though she has worked here for 16 years. She for sure is the most hated manager on our payroll (consensus by employees and fellow managers). She is also known for going to HR, even my general manager doesn't like her but can't do anything about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you guys need any extra details or clarifications\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Let me just preface this by saying I understand the whole idea of “punching down” and “punching up” when it comes to minority groups. It’s more acceptable to talk poorly about the oppressor than the oppressed because kicking someone while they’re down is worse than being spiteful of a priveleged group you aren’t part of. That being said, I’m a straight white guy so I can only talk in theory.\n\nAnyways over the past month or so I’ve been trying to understand the whole “you don’t get it or like it because you’re straight” or “oh we’ll talk later about this honey” when it comes to a talking about the LGBT community, along with all of the jabs towards straight people which make me think they look down on me. We’ve been friends for about a year now, so we’re all at that level where we don’t really filter things anymore, but with that came this sort of condescending attitude towards me because how could I possibly get it. And I can’t, sure, but I’ve supported them from day one and I’ve never done anything to disrespect who they are, so why should I be the one getting this attitude? They wouldn’t be my friends if I was some bigot and know that I’m an ally.\n\nI know the straight jokes are all generalized, but being the only straight guy in the group makes me feel like I don’t mean as much to them because I don’t have a gender or sexuality that’s unique, and how that somehow makes me less woke than them in general (not even with just LGBT stuff). So no, I don’t have to deal with the hate against a specific group and that makes me priveleged, but do I really deserve this animosity towards me? I’m mentioning this now because it’s starting to make me angry and I feel like if I don’t that I’m going to have to find new friends. \n\nPS they do know that I don’t appreciate it but I’ve never said it outright. I usually just tell them “alright, whatever”, or something along those lines. If anyone, particularly LGBT people who are friends with straight people or vice versa, could give me advice on how to deal with this or tell me if I’m wildly wrong, I’d appreciate it. ",

      "description": "So my now ex girlfriend has had an ex cheat on her before and you add that to her already existing anxiety she has a lot of trust issues. She would constantly \"test\" the relationship and spy on me. This would mean going through my emails and my texts when I was asleep and checking my in on me at work through my work landline instead of my cell.\n\nSo recently I finally was at my breaking point and told her that she is out of chances. That if she doesn't start trusting me that we are done. That means no more going through my phone or email, no more calling me on the work phone, none of it. She agreed but for piece of mind I recruited my coworker and good friend the next day. I deleted our entire text history, changed his name in my phone to a girls name and we send very dirty and explicit texts back and forth.\n\nSo that night she goes through my phone and wakes me up saying that she knew I was cheating on her holding my phone as proof. I don't correct her about who was really on the other end of those texts I just told her that I am not fighting that she has to leave and she needs to get her shit out at the end of the week.\n\nSo while my coworker/buddy agrees that I needed to dump her he thinks it was a bit of a dick move not to tell her it was actually him and to let her assume she had another ex cheat on her. The way I see it I tried everything I could while we were dating to help her get past her anxiety and to show her I wasn't cheating but she refused to help herself so it is no longer my responsibility worry about her insecurities.\n\nBut I figure I would ask you fine people.

      "description": "So there is this couple (28 M &amp; F) that I (21F) have known for several years. We are all part of a large mutual friend group. They are getting married this summer and I am reluctant to go because I am still hurt over a situation that happened 2 years ago. \n\nThe story goes my bf (24) and I were hanging out with the couple in their home having some beers and chatting. She was sitting on the couch next to my boyfriend and I was sitting on the floor while her now fiancé was sitting in a chair. He told me that I could share the chair with him so I didn’t have to sit on the floor. Thinking nothing of it, I sat next to him on the chair and we continued our conversation. She went ballistic on me. Started calling me a whore, a bitch, a skank, all because I sat next to her boyfriend on the chair (even though she was sitting next to my boyfriend on the couch) and was accusing me of trying to steal him. I ran home sobbing, guilty over something I didn’t do wrong. My boyfriend was comforting me and her boyfriend eventually came over to apologize for her behavior, blaming it on the alcohol. \n\nAfter this situation happened, I was willing to let it go if she had just apologized for the situation. Rather than apologizing, they stopped talking to me for 6 months. My boyfriend tried asking the couple what their problem and her boyfriend stated that her feelings were “valid” and they needed space from me. I don’t know how someone could need space from me while all I did was sit next to him in a chair? Even my boyfriend believes that they’re the fucked ones in the situation. \n\nBy the 6th month my boyfriend was trying to get me to speak to the couple and let bygones be bygones. I didn’t want there to be any more drama within our friend group so I just let it go. I secretly haven’t let it go because I was extremely hurt by her comments and her boyfriend defending her even though he was the one that asked me to sit next to him. They are getting married out of state where I will have to be spending over $200 for a plane ticket and spend even more money on a hotel. My boyfriend is in the wedding party so I feel like I have to go even though I don’t want to. \n\nI’ve expressed my feelings of still being hurt to my boyfriend and other mutual friends, but they all say I should let it go because they have and it happened over 2 years ago. AITA or petty for not wanting to go to their wedding? \n\nTLDR: couple is getting married and I don’t want to go to their wedding because the woman called me harsh names over something I never did and she never apologized for it.

      "description": "Sunday I (26/f) was invited over to boyfriend's house after he had been out the night before at a bachelor party. I hadn't heard from him all night, he claimed his phone died, whatever. I got in touch with him the next morning. He was hungover, so I asked if he was just going to be miserable in bed all day; I didn't just want to be in bed all day while he was nursing a hangover. He said no, and that he intended to start drinking when he and his roommate got back from the store (it was 9am). I thought he was kidding...\n\nI arrive, with multiple items after several stops he requested so we could make something for dinner. He was already into the vodka and fireball. I work nights, and didn't have to be at work until 9pm the next night, I thought, what the hell, and had a couple shots myself and some wine. An hour or so goes by and he goes to his bedroom to lay down. He puts on some videos (cops or whatever) and I suggest a movie since he was passing out anyway.\n\nOne of my favorites was playing, The Big Lebowski. Bf was chatty, in and out, a little flirty, but was likely a little tipsy, as was I. I was chatting to him about the movie. He asked me to go get him cake. I brought it back, continued to give him movie trivia, and his tone and demeanor quickly changed. Angrily \"I'm just trying to take a nap, sorry I don't care about your shitty movie!\" I was floored. I forgot exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of berating me for talking to me like garbage (a conversation we also had the night before). I was mad and flustered and started to collect my things to leave.\n\nOn my way home, I realized I had forgotton the license plates he was going to put on that day. I was pretty pissed at myself, but had to turn around to get them. He confronted me in the living room, was apologetic, asked me to lie down with him...I was already too creeped out and in tears, railing off about how disrespectful he was.\n\n Him: \"All I want to do is lie down\"\nMe: \"then I'm fucking leaving, why did you have me come over to begin with?\"\n\nI stormed out and collected more of my things. The next day I cleaned my stuff completely out of his place and left his key on the table, not trying to be passive aggressive, but transparent. I haven't heard from him since, I don't intend to see him again.\n\nTl;dr, boyfriend of a few months with possible drinking problem, talks to me like crap. I intend to ghost him after clearing house of my things. ",

I just can’t handle it. I’ve been alone with toddlers all day. When he comes home I don’t want to hear about all these problems. I really don’t want to hear about anything at all. I need some time and space. \n\nThe main problem is that what he has to say is mostly complaints. About whatever may have happened that day. Sometimes he’s doing a frustrating job and it gets worse. It’s too much to listen to when I don’t have the mental capacity for it. And because it’s business related, and his business is our livelihood, it starts giving me anxiety hearing about the issues. Sometimes he’ll take work calls in front of me, for what seems like no reason. Like he’ll be in the kitchen, get a phone call, come to the living room in the middle of my show just so I have to hear the call?\n\nI bring this up, voice my concerns, and it goes right back the next day. Usually he’ll start, I’ll cut him off and say “hey, maybe we could talk about this in an hour or so. Actually, now that you’re home and you can watch the kids, I’d like to be alone for a couple minutes. That’s why I came to our bedroom and closed the door...and you followed me in here...” Sometimes when what he has to say is really complaining I just say flat out I’m not interested in hearing about it at all.\n\nEven if he stops the venting stuff, it annoys the fuck out of me how he wants to hang out as soon as he gets home. Sometimes I don’t want to casually chat either, not right away. Again, I’ve been with toddlers all day. I want thirty minutes where no one is speaking to me, asking me something, even making noise around me. \n\nHe ALWAYS takes offense. I have tried and tried explaining that I just can’t have him unload all of his shit on me if I’m not ready for it. He ALWAYS brings it back to me not caring about his day or wanting to talk to him. I get that he’s been alone a lot of the day, but I just can’t handle it and it’s really becoming a problem with me that he doesn’t understand.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I asked calmly at first for them to stop. Showing vet documents from people who have had their pets die from oil usage. My mother blew up in my face saying how she wasn't stupid and didn't need a child telling her what to do. I retaliated (I probably shouldn't of but I was angry and worried for my animals) stating she was stupid for listening to brainwashing from places like Doterra. She stormed off abd my father had demanded I go into my room.\nI've been getting the silent treatment since.\nThey still use the oils.\n\nAm I the asshole for bringing up my concerns about my animals and their \"new way to keep the house smelling nice\"\n",

      "description": "I think I’m something of a reserved person, and I’m just not used to confronting people, so I feel like what I need to do and have to say about my brother’s ex could be asshole territory so I want a second opinion. \n\n\nBasically, my brother met his ex a few years ago and she changed his life for the better. Before this, he could be downright vicious. He would scream at my parents for telling him to do homework, beat me, and choke me for saying things that any brother would. But I’ve forgiven all of this, because he truly became a better person. He went to a great school and came out better because of their relationship.\n\nDuring the time he went to college (where she attended as well), they seemed to just *hate* each other. What was once a mutually beneficial relationship soured and they were on again and off again for years. Basically, she would lock him out of their apartment, and just do erratic things in general that nearly sent him to the brink of suicide.\n\n But I’ve always felt that their relationship was weird beyond that. My brother never had a girlfriend before (he was 17, she was 24) and brought her home to meet my parents immediately and demanded that they get her a car and pay for an apartment for them both (she was living with her parents at the time). Today, all that she pays for is her car payment, everything else in her life my parents are paying for (rent, cable, you name it). And my parents aren’t wealthy, they just wanted my brother to be happy. But when they were attending college my brother’s girlfriend asked my parents to get them a new apartment and she would start paying rent finally, but she didn’t. This caused a great deal of stress for my parents.\n\nAnd she lies constantly. The first night we met her, she lied about being a National Merit Scholar. She’s lied about paying my parents back and postpones paying them back constantly, and she constantly fakes illnesses to get out of work and school. And she has so much drama in her life, everyday she comes home from work she has some kind of fight with a friend going on. She’s lost nearly every friend she’s made. If you ask me, that might say a lot about a person.\n\nWhile my brother, Alex, was dating her she started somehow accompanying us everywhere and saying that she loves my mother and father. I thought it was weird, then she tried to get me to say I love her. I didn’t want to, and still don’t. It was just really strange to me. My brother and her weren’t married. They had been together for less than a year. As far as I’m concerned, this is just some random stranger who my parents pay for everything in her life even though she works two jobs.\n\nToday, she wants me to be her roommate as I’m going to attend the same university that my brother did (his girlfriend dropped out and seems to not intend to graduate), but I’ve seen how she lives. I can handle a messy apartment, but not the smell of rotting food in dishes. And she has a new boyfriend, who shares my exact name and also has a brother named Alex, oddly enough. I could go on about all the thousands of dollars my parents have spent on her and how she’ll never pay them back, how untrustworthy I find her to be. I don’t want to be her brother, and I sure as hell don’t want to be her roommate and have my parents pay for everything in her life.\n\nBut what do you think from this information? AITA?",

      "description": "Not so much an am I *the* asshole but rather am I *an* asshole\n\nI took $68.50(yes I even took the change...) from the biodad of my 43 week old preemie son / soon to be ex husband with drug addiction. I don't know how to feel. \n\nBasically this is my inner monologue: \n\n**'he's a drug addict, he would've just used it to get high', 'he's his son as well and is entitled to that money' or 'he's your son, your responsibly, you do whatever you gotta do to provide for him'**\n\n*'yes he's your responsibility- exactly- what would've happened if he had caught you and called the police?'*\n\n**they more than likely would've arrested him as he likely has illegal things in that apt of his**\n\n*'no they would probably have taken us both in- him for possession of whatever it is he has and you for theft, they would notify CPS that your sons father is a junkie and that his mother is in the middle of a divorce, just got laid off and has resorted to theft in order to take care of him'*\n\nWhen people started talking I always took his side and he even managed to buy a drug test and then wait for the results with me, which ofc= negative. The charade was over when he was fired for failing a random drug test. Our home voicemail got the message. He blamed me for his losing his job which is just..wow how high are you rn..because he'd used the fake pee he'd ordered online TO FOOL ME and didn't have any when random testing day came along. \n\nAnyways, this morning I drove by his apt building to ask him for help in paying for our sons meds and he wasn't home. (he was 17 days prem and has BPD- was on a ventilator for a long time and still sometimes needs oxygen/regularly takes a meds via his nebulizer). He picked up when I called but said he couldn't help. Ofc not. Out of sheer desperation I took his spare key and went inside his unit and lo ad behold 60 bucks and some change in his nightstand. I took it without a second thought and left. I didn't do it to spite him. My only goal was to care for my son.\n\nSoon after: he calls. raging. saying said he'll call his lawyer and take my son away and ruin my life. I told him no judge worth a grain of salt would ever sign over custody of a newborn to a deadbeat junkie who can't spare $50 to pay for said newborns meds and hung up. That was 3 hrs. ago. But now my son has meds for the next 2 wks and by then I'm sure I'll have something figured out.\n\nBut is it ever okay to do what I did? Addict or not, father of my child or not, I entered his apt &amp; took his $ without consent. What kind of example am I setting for my son? Is it ever justifiable or am I just trying to make excuses for myself. I feel like an idiot for letting my life come to this and even worse for whining and feeling sorry for myself. If there's an emoji for dejectedly slamming one's head on their keyboard[insert that here].\n\n\nI needed to get this off my chest. Sorry.\n\n",

      "description": "Before I get judged to quickly, let me explain. \n22 years ago, I had a one night stand and accidentally got the woman pregnant. I didn’t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn’t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who’s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn’t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I’m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my “real” family as opposed to her because I haven’t paid anything for her college career. But, there’s so many reason I’m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I’m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son’s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I’m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son’s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It’s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I’m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don’t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I’m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she’s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to “fuck off you sexist asshole”. I didn’t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she’s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son’s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter’s grad degree and I’m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?",

There are 2 girls in real life that I flirt with constantly, nothing major just some light teasing and the occasional proposal (they are rich so I propose to them so I am called the gold digger). \n\nHere's one of the problems, I dont like either of them, I hook up with one of them but that's about it, I have no intentions of pushing the boundaries because I don't want to and I dont feel it's appropriate. I have never asked them to pay for anything for me or they have done so.\n\nMy next problem is that I seriously close with two different girls I've met online. Again I dont like either one but jesus hell, I listen to their problems and talk to them about and next thing I know they are planning trips to meet me. I might sleep with them but I don't want a relationship. It's gotten to a point where I don't know what to feel and I feel embarrassed to tell them that I dont expect anything from this.

      "description": "So last Thursday was my birthday and I decided to throw a party that following Friday for my acquaintances and close friends and I also planned to go on a hiking trail for just my girlfriend and I that following Sunday. \n\nNow I was more excited for hiking since its about an two hours away and its a popular trail. I like to get there as early as possible and since the park opened at 8am I thought to leave my house by 6am so I can get there on time. I told my girlfriend plenty of times about this plan and she confirmed she understood.\n\nBut my girlfriends co worker had a birthday too but it was that following Saturday and I was aware about it but I wasn't aware that they would go out drinking that night. So I told my girlfriend if she still was going to able to be ready by 6am the next day which was Sunday. She assured me that she would be ready by then and that I shouldn't worry, I didn't go with her because we all got trashed on my birthday and I wanted to rest up for the hike.\n\nSo that Sunday I wake up at 5:30am and I text her if she is ready and I get no response, I wait another 15 minutes and I call her and still no answer. So I leave my house and by the time I am about 30 minutes away from the park I get a text message but I ignore it since I am on the highway and the road to the park at that point gets really windy. I park and I see a bunch of texts from her saying if I was still going to pick her up and where I was. I responded to her that I was at the park already and I will text her when I am done. \n\nThe park has no reception, so I completed one the trails and it took a good chunk of the day and by the time I was heading home it was late afternoon. I called her and told her I was on my way but I was tired and in need of a shower and since my girlfriend doesn't drive I would've had to stop by her house then mine. She said she was upset that I left her and that I am an asshole for doing so, I reminded her that I planned this for a while. She hung up and I went home to pass out from the hike.\n\nShe is till upset and told me that this is a possible deal breaker since I am not boyfriend material for leaving her behind.\n\nAITA for leaving her behind?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They mess around and laugh with eachother while I'm talking to someone else, and its honestly kind of upsetting. I've begun to feel like the second best friend, so I decided to talk to her about it. I told her how she's forgetting about me for this guy shes only known for a small amount of time. I told her that the way they are around each other (being flirty and being physically close) makes me uncomfortable and that if they are around me, to not act that way.\n\n I don't want to make her choose, but I've known her for 10 years I should have some level of priority to her.

Dad made me print resumes (he and mum said that's how they got their first jobs) and hand them to businesses but the places told me to submit online and they don’t take paper anymore. Mum and Dad both said I didn’t convince them hard enough.\n\nThe other day I got a job at a competing fast-food business and accepted (it’s only a 45min bus ride after school!).

One of his friends has confirmed for me that the trip is happening. They will be backpacking and staying in hostels so it wouldn't be expensive. He went on and on about how amazing this trip would be and all the things they will get to see.\n\nI've told him before how my mother used to backpack around Europe and that I've always wanted to try it someday, but I don't think he even considered bringing me.

      "description": "My friend and I hang out a lot, but recently our dynamic has changed. About a month ago I told her I liked her, but that I didn't expect her to feel the same way and I hoped our relationship would remain intact. We have been very close and not much has changed.\n\nRecently, however, she has been treating me like dirt. I would want to hang out with her and be near her, but she would tell me to f*** off. I figured she was just in a bad mood, (confirmed by mutual friends) but she doesn't seem to have a problem with anyone but me.\n\nI talked to a few of our friend and apparently she is going through a really tough time right now, and she felt super bad for telling me off the way she did. I have been giving her as much space as I possibly can. When she walks into a room and ignores me, I leave until she is gone. I feel like I've done everything I can to let her process what she needs to, but she doesn't seem to feel bad at all anymore.\n\nThis has had a huge impact on my life recently. She has made me feel like dirt by pushing me away. At this point, I'm not even sure I like her romantically anymore, but this is still hurting me because she's one of my best friends.\n\nI don't even know what she's mad about, and all of my friends are saying she feels bad about what she's been doing, but she's done nothing to change it or even apologize. I sent her a few texts apologizing for whatever I may have done wrong and asking what I could do to fix it, but she's ignored them.\n\nMy only solution I have left is to walk up to her and tell her what she is doing to me. How this isn't because of me liking her, but because she is my friend. But with all of the stuff she's going through, it may just make things worse.",

He's married and has a child now but he still bugs me to come over all the time and I just don't get it.\n\nI don't necessarily hate or dislike the guy, he has been generous with me and he isn't a shitty person. But I'm 27 and single, honestly, I'm trying to get my shit straight and not hang out all the time. But everytime I go over his place, he ramps back up and bugs me constantly for a couple weeks until he backs off again. I've gotten to the point where I just ignore his calls and texts, not entirely to be a dick, I just am busy a lot of the time too. \n\nI'm also looking for any advice on how to get him to stop being so clingy. I just do get really annoyed when he's basically texting me a few hours after hanging out with him, to hang out again. ",

      "description": "Longtime lurker, mobile, Yadayadayada\n\nI was relaxing on my computer when I started feeling sick to my stomach. I turn off my PC and check downstairs to see if dinner is ready (my room is upstairs) dinner was briskit in a pressure cooker, but wasnt fully cooked for another 10 minutes and then time to prepare so I went back upstairs. (Important later, my dad was sitting at the bottom of the stairs seemingly happily petting the dog, sister machine potatoes and mom doing whatever to prepare food)\n\nSo I go back upstairs and set my phone down and try to shut my eyes thinking I would relax for 15 minutes then get up and go to dinner. But again, my stomach was still really upset. I few minutes in my mom texts me and asks \"Hey would you come down and play with [dog] for a few min...\" the text cut off, I assumed that was it but the full text was \"Hey would you come down and play with Nala for a bit?  Dads trying to work and she's not leaving him alone.  Josie and I are making dinner.\" \n\nThe thing is I didn't see this part, and because I was sick to my stomach I ignored it, I really wasnt feeling good.\nAdventually my mom calls me and says to come down, I go okay okay and trudge my way downstairs, where the mood was kinda bad. My dad was on his computer at the table across from the island we normally eat at. He was obviously stressed and I assumed he had a bad day at work (I still haven't seen the full text, and never did until writing this) my mom apologizes and says the brisket is bad, because the cut of meat was bad. That was true, she cooked it find, but it was very fatty and weird for brisket. \n\nI kinda entertain the dog for a minute, dog goes outside, dog comes inside, I start eating. (By the way its pouring outside, which is rare for where I live) I'm eating and my dad is mad. He gets up to take the dog for a walk (in the rain) and says something like \"I shouldn't have to entertain [dog] it's stupid that I work so hard to put this food on the table and you cant have it prepared for me\" (by it he refers to having dog tired for when he comes home) so my sister is very surprised, I dont say anything, my mom says a few words. I assume he will sleep ir off and we will forget this thing. He comes back and starts talking more about \"you cant spend 30 minute to wear our the dog\" then gives her a bone and says \"instead of playing with her we'll just give her a bone that's bad for her and shorten her lifespand\" which seemed like it was supposed to be a joke but just didnt work\n\nI clean my plate, and grab a toy and try to play with her, she seems only interested in her bone. I grab her bone and play with her for like a minute, but I was afraid I would lose ber interest if i didnt let her have it. She crawls onto her dog bed. \n\nAfter that I just go back upstairs and start writing this.\n\ntl;dr: Didnt play with dog because I was sick to my stomach, dad was angry at us for not tiring her out.",

      "description": "My boyfriend had planned a trip to Vegas for us to go visit a friend that lived there. I’m in nursing school and unfortunately school got in the way and my sister happened to be visiting that weekend from out of state and I couldn’t go. He was so devastated that I couldn’t go, I had truly never seen him so mad. But, I decided that school and my sister is more important than a Vegas trip.\n\nSo he decided that he would go by himself. The friends of his own a strip club. I don’t care that he went to a strip club at all, he can do what he wants in that realm, he’s in Vegas after all. So because he knew the owners he got to be in VIP at the strip club. \n\nFrom what he told me he was “super drunk” and got to talking with this one stripper. He told me that they talked for two hours just about “life” and “nothing sexual at all”. After awhile somehow she asked for his number and he gave it to her. He texted her that night things like “go get your money girl” or “you’re killing it”. This is just what he has told me. Somehow she found out he was dating me or he told her, I’m not sure how that went down? And then the stripper blocked him on Instagram and blocked his phone number! Super strange how would she even have his Instagram!? Then he proceeded to delete all the text messages between them.\n\nAnyways... when he got back from Vegas he was telling me about this situation like it was not big deal. And all about how good looking this stripper was and how he would love it if I dyed my hair like hers. I couldn’t help but feel like I had been cheated on! It really hurt my feelings and I expressed to him that it was not okay at all. He refused to understand my side of the story just saying that she was a “friend” or whatever. \n\nThe next day, I was so upset I expressed to him again how much this hurt me and I feel like I have been emotionally cheated on. He had some remorse but still didn’t understand how I was so hurt by this. I started crying and all that kinda stuff because I was so hurt. \n\nI eventually let it go because I love and care about him. But about a week ago he claimed that I had thrown a “temper tantrum” at the situation. I’m so incredibly upset about this whole thing. His “chillness” about the whole thing makes me feel like I may be over reacting. Do I have the right to be mad about this whole thing? Is there something I’m missing that the texting was really just okay? Am I the asshole in this thing? ",

      "description": "TLDR: Got drunk one night, damaged a friendship, tried to repair it. Now they’re finally reaching out... to invite me to a baby shower.\n\nSo these friends are married. We’d been friends since high school and I’d known both of them since before they even started dating. I stood next to him at his wedding. I helped him move into his house. We talked at least once a week and made it a point to hang out at least once a month. They’d been trying to have a baby for a while, and were starting to worry maybe they couldn’t.\n\nAnyway, our story begins roughly six or seven months ago, in the fall of 2018. We were hanging out at a bonfire in the woods and drinking. I had a bit too much and blacked out for most of the evening.\n\nFast forward about a month and a half. I haven’t heard anything from this friend or his wife. As far as I know they’ve just been busy. Now, a group of us usually get together for Halloween and have been doing so for going on ten years at this point. It’s a bit of a tradition and these friends usually host it. Thinking that they must be busy, I reach out to see if they need any help with the party.\n\nAt this point my friend responds saying that they actually have the party under control, but that he and his wife had decided not to invite me. Apparently, during that night of drinking I had made a rather offensive joke about their not having a baby yet. I couldn’t say what it was exactly because I don’t even remember making it. I immediately apologize profusely, making it clear that I would never have said something like that sober and that the only reason I hadn’t apologized already was that I had no idea it had happened.\n\nAbout a month after this, we finally meet up to talk it out and part ways on good terms. I invite them to a New Years Party at my house. I think we’ve worked it out.\n\nA few weeks later, I end up in the hospital after an accident at work. He does come see me in the hospital, and about a month later he comes to my New Years Party, but leaves early. That was the last I saw or talked to him. We’ve only texted maybe three times since all this started and all of them started with me sending the first message.\n\nHis wife hasn’t seen or talked to me since fall. I think she was obviously far more hurt than he was, and on top of that is now pregnant.\n\nNow I’ve received a Facebook invite to their baby shower.\n\nI do want to salvage this relationship. Prior to this we had been planning a vacation together. I expected them to be the godparents of my children someday. I recognize that the rift was started by my drunken actions, and I’ve taken responsibility for that.\n\nBut after six months of estrangement and the last three months of silence, getting such an impersonal invite to a “give us stuff” event rubs me the wrong way.\n\nAITA for not wanting to go?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my fathers ex-girlfriend to submit a claim through his estate for money she said he owed her after he died?",
      "description": "so, first post here, I will do my best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father died in October of 2018 after a seven day battle with stage 4 cancer.  He was a heavy smoker for about 40 years so it wasn't a complete surprise that it happened but we didnt think he would get sick and pass away within a week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day he passed away my wife took care of him and his ex-girlfriend/ friend was there with him as he passed.  Literally as the funeral home was taking him out of his apartment, my wife and the ex-gf were sitting there.  As soon as the door shut she looks as my dad and says \"By the way, he owed me money, but you don't need to deal with it right now.\"  Needless to say my wife was shocked and just kind of looked at her.  A couple of weeks went by and the ex-gf stops by my house and bring a small 3x3 inch spiral notebook full of her hand written notes of money that she had lent him.  There are things in this notebook that seem reasonable and others that are out of line.  Things like \"lent $5000 for surgery\" or  \"moving expenses\"  and others like \"12.75 for McDonalds\" or \"$5.40 for coffee\". The total of these items is somewhere near $25,000. This blew my mind.  Who keeps track of things that you either bought or loaned someone over the course of 20 years?  I took the notebook and didnt say anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father died with little to no money.  He had nothing in his bank account, nothing in retirement and no life insurance.  The only things he owned were a 12 year old car, the items in his apartment and a home across the state that he has been leasing to the same person for about 15 years.  The home is maybe worth $80,000.  I have paid all legal fees, paid for the funeral and any other items that needed to be handled out of my own pocket.  The last thing I have to do is sell the car and the house and I will be done with it.  When we met with our attorney I mentioned the debt that the ex-gf said my father owed.  He told us absolutely not to pay her out of our own account and that she should file a claim against the estate.  This will protect my family from any future claims that we need to pay more and is the appropriate way to handle debts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to send the notebook back to the ex-gf with a letter suggesting that she file a claim against the estate.  I also told her that since the only documentation she has is her notebook, I have no way of knowing what arrangements her and my father may have had or if she similarly owed him for anything as well.  I also advised her that it was not personal but the best way to protect my families finances in this situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wrote back and said how disappointed in us she is and that she lent him that money and he said that he would pay her back.  That it came from her retirement and we should not make her go through this process to get her money back as he would have wanted it all paid back, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for suggesting she file the claim against the estate rather than paying out of my pocket once and if I sell the house? Or is there better way to deal with situations like this?",

He said he would, but he didn't seem super excited because her roommate was going to be there and he doesn't really like being around her. I asked because I wanted to know if my girlfriend, who lives 45 minutes away, could stay the night with me and we could have some alone time. He knew that was my motivation for asking and probably why he agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome Valentine's Day, he tells me he's probably going to stay in the dorm. Apparently his gf's roommate had plans to go out and not be in the dorm, but her plans fell through so he wanted to stay in our dorm, possible with his girlfriend. I got upset because it messed up my plans and I felt like he could've done more to spare my plans. He got upset and said I was being ungrateful because he made plans for me and then I got upset cause they didn't work out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know he's got a right to the room and I'm not upset that he wanted to stay there. I was upset that he said he'd do one thing and then changed it. It's not like he hasn't stayed the night with his gf and her roommate before. He's not required to protect my plans but I feel like he it wouldn't have been that big of a deal for him to stay with them any way so both of our plans wouldn't get messed up. So AITA?",

I have made it clear to some people, however, that i won't support their choice by referring to them as their pronoun, even though i generally won't refer to them as i'm not really friends with any, and i won't make a fuss about people being trans, that's their choice. Word got around and now this trans person knows about it. So one day we were waiting for class to be over, and one of my friends starts play fighting with some other kid. The trans person (We'll refer to them as A) says \"Now now, ladies, settle down.\" I decided to crack a joke. \"Hey, don't misgender him!\" I know that joke sucks, but back then the \"misgendered\" joke was at least a little funny. This set A off, however, and A began screaming and getting in my face about how i'm hypocritical and how i misgender people. I just stood and said \"Ok\" until B stormed off. I've never gotten any backlash from this incident, but i was wondering how other people think about it. Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "So let me just address this first, most of my life I have been a \"bigger\" guy and have most of my life been bullied for it. This would include Kindergarten through high school which is 8+ years of my life. I've never really stood up for myself because I would get made fun of for going to a teacher and telling them what was going on. So I put up with it, except when I got to 8th grade. During this year when everyone had decided what high school they'd be going to I noticed something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI has the best grades in both of the 8th grade classes. Once I figured this out, I knew exactly how I could get back at them for bullying me. Since no one wanted to be associated with me, I spent most of my time at home constantly doing homework and studying and getting help from my parents when I needed it. By the time we were meeting to see who all got scholarships at our church (I went to a Catholic school so we had one) We waited to see who got what scholarships. The looks on their faces after it was over is something I will always remember (including the parents). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes some did get scholarships from different colleges I wasn't going to, but they only gave it to one student. I received many awards for my grades as well as my services during mandatory mass and even received a server of the year award many others thought they would receive. The biggest scholarship however, was a two-thousand five hundred dollar scholarship to a high school of the student's choosing, and guess who got it :). The scholarship is awarded by the principal of the school and the teachers who teach 8th grade. Both the teachers and student pick a student who has excelled in their education and has shown how much they care about their grades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was given this scholarship I could see both happy smiles, but moreover dirty looks. My parents were so proud of me for doing so well and earning so many scholarships. Now the main school that a bunch of my classmates wanted to go to is a really nice private high school who's tuition is anything far from cheap and earning scholarships there could have really helped lessen the cost per year. So the real question I'm dying to know from other people who know nothing about to avoid a biased answer, is Am I the Asshole for this, or are my old classmates? ",

      "description": "I was wondering if I (21M) am the asshole for not staying friend with a girl (18F) who's not certain about dating me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle backstory, I met her 2 years ago. It was summer and we were working at the same place. Unexpectedly, she became interested in me and we began to hang out. Problem is, she was still in a relationship, she was unsure of what to do but kept saying that she liked me and that I was truly special. As for me, I was insecure, awkward and terrifed of losing the first girl that ever liked me.\n\nWell, it didn't lasted long. Two month. She did eventually left him for me, but I completed a self-fulfilly prophecy by ghosting her, coming back and simply being an asshole because of my fear of losing her. It killed the relationship, we stopped contact and she found another guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe never kept in touch after. She did tried to reach me many times for friendship by missing \"what we had\" but each time it ended in me still wanting a relationship with her and refusing as she already had a boyfriend. I blocked her, for it seemed the best choice for both of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo year later, we met again at the same school. I see her sometimes with her boyfriend. One day, she sent me a long hand-written letter telling me that she never stopped loving me, that I am still special for her, that she broke up with her boyfriend to have a chance to talk to me and that she'd like to try again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSaying that I felt the luckiest guy in the world would be an understatement : I was shaking of joy. We began texting each other, and met in person plenty of time. It went amazing : the chemistry was there and we both liked our compagny. However, two weeks later, she said to me that she was uncertain about dating me. It felt weird. She elaborated by asking me too wait \"A couple of months\" to let her adjust to me and by the meantime we could be casual friend. She's also adamant about staying in contact because for two years she felt like shit going NoContact with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI refused and after many arguments I blocked her. I know what I want : I want to date her because that's how I feel about her. I can wait weeks but I find that months is really long. The uncertainty is killing me and ruining my grades since I keep thinking about her. She's telling me I am selfish and that I don't care about her and i am acting like a child. Since that, I feel awful and always wondering if I did the right thing. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Girl like me. She says she want to date me. Turns out she is uncertain and want to wait a couple of months. I block her. She find me selfish.",

I'd still go home to see everyone but I just dont want anything else to be done.\n\nI live in a different state as the rest of my family so I don't physically see my family a lot so all of the background I had to hear from my brothers.

      "description": "Long-time reader, first-time poster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm turning 30 in May.  Frankly, I'm blessed to have grown up with the family and support system that I have.  It has enabled me to do fairly well for myself and to afford some luxuries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing as I'm leaving my 20's (and since I love celebrating my birthday), I decided to do something special to celebrate.  I rented a boat for me and 60 of my friends and family to go cruising around a large lake and harbourfront on a Saturday night.  I'm paying for the boat and for all 60 of my guests.  There will be a DJ, served appetizers and birthday cake (as well as unlimited, free non-alcoholic drinks).  As for alcoholic drinks, there will be a cash bar on board.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy intention in outlining all of this is not to aggrandize myself, but to provide context.  The contract that I signed with the boat owners/operators stipulates that the vessel is licensed under applicable liquor laws and that no outside alcohol is allowed aboard.  I've mentioned this a few times to my guests through invitations and in conversations.  Frankly, I'm concerned about liability or contract violation if my guests bring alcohol aboard, drink it, get hammered and then end up getting hurt or breaking something.  Accordingly, I've asked that people refrain from bringing outside booze aboard and instead make use of the cash bar or pre-drink before they board.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of my friends have expressed (both jokingly and unjokingly) that they intend to bring their own alcohol, anyway.  As yet, I haven't really gotten confrontational - I've just politely maintained that they should not do so and that there are other options available.  Still others have said that I should turn a blind eye to anyone who does express such an intention and that I've done my part in stating that outside alcohol is not allowed.  In their opinion, I needn't worry myself about enforcement.  Some of my friends/guests are life-time grad students with little to no disposable income, which I suppose is worthy of mention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting on no outside alcohol?  I don't  want people to feel that they can't have a good time or drink - I just don't wish to attract needless liability or risk by violating an agreement or to invite greater possibility for injury or damage.  As well, I confess that I'm also a bit annoyed that, even after I foot the bill for nearly everything, some people are still trying to get something for nothing.",

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster, on mobile, etc. \nSo background, I work at a car dealership about 45 minutes from my house (on a good drive). As a recent college graduate, I still live with my parents. Tonight, my step-father and his kids are out of town for a ski trip, so it's just me and my mom. She's been a bit off recently, having trouble with her memory and getting more clumsy. Onto the event. \n\nI usually get off work at around 5, but I had some things to finish up so I didn't leave work until 6. I drive straight through the heart of a fairly large city on my commute, so if there's traffic it can take me up to an hour and a half to get home. I got lucky, and arrived home around 7. \nMy mom seems frustrated about something and is being generally passive aggressive, so I asked her what was wrong. She asked me why I was home so late, and the following conversation ensued;\n\nMe: I stayed to finish up a couple things at work, why? \n\nMom: What, you just stay up there and drink and smoke pot with your friends?\n\nMe: No... what are you talking about?\n\nMom: We had plans tonight? (At this point she's near tears) We were going to go to dinner and decorate the Christmas tree?? \n\nMe: Wait, what? When did we make these plans?\n\nShe then gave me the \"I don't want to talk to you right now\" hand that only moms can perfect. She insists we had plans but I genuinely do NOT remember making them. I apologized and explained this, but she seems to think I did this on purpose, and refuses to accept my apology. I also offered to hang out and watch movies or something to try and spend some time with her. Am I the asshole for being a bit annoyed at her attitude about it? \n\nTL;DR I don't remember making plans with my mom and she is now so angry over it that she wont speak to me. ",

      "description": "For some context, me (24M) and my girlfriend(22F) have been together for 5 years and we just moved together this year. \n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n\nSummer 2017 we had some issues because she wanted to finish school at her hometown and I wasn’t feeling a long distance relationship so we decided to break up, she moved and I stayed in the house we rented, it was really my decision all tough she understood my case. It wasn’t easy on me because I still loved her but I have been on long distance before and I did not wanted to again. I was sure of it.\n\nMove forward something of a month and I met someone (lets call her Isa), we were hanging out a lot and becoming really food friends, we met in some weird circumstances, we were both given the opportunity to move to the same place, all paid for 6 months to work on the same project and we took it. Knowing this we hang out even more and at some point Isa told me she liked me but she had a boyfriend, they were having issues and were about to break up as well because she was moving out. We did nothing more than go out and a few kisses here and there up until she broke up with him and we had sex. That was really it, after that I realised I still had feelings for my ex, I talked to Isa about it she understand and we remained really good friends, that was the end of it. \n\nWhile all of this was happening we were also doing paperwork to move to the new place, it was really an exciting new work opportunity, great company, amazing new salary but then…I was denied the work visa, she wasn’t. Isa ended up moving around November and as I said before we remained good friends.\n\nWhen I did’t got my visa I saw the positive side that it was new chance to reconnect with my ex and I had all this new found feelings, everything happens for a reason kind of thing, we re-connected I told her about Isa because I wanted to be fully honest, I explained we remained friends and is not something that was really negotiable as it was that, a friend. Anyhow we started dating again, it was only long distance for around 5 months as she told me she regretted leaving and wanted to come back but had to finish school. They weren't really easy 5 months...\n\nMoving forward a bit more Isa came back around June this year, of course we kept talking all the time she was away “How are you doing?” “How is life?” etc etc. When she came back it was really cool we were hanging out with the same group of friends and doing bunch of stuff, on the summer the group took a trip together and it was awesome. Isa has become a really good friend over this year and there is no intention of anything from any party as we HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, but now, my GF hates her. \n\nI have tried to talk to her rationally, telling her its just a friend and yes we had a history a year ago, a year ago! and without that history honestly I wouldn’t even be back with my girlfriend today… and still today, that we live together once again, I get shit over it “why are you taking to her?” “is she gonna be around all the time?”, I feel like I had a choice to NOT go back to my girlfriend and have a long distance with her for a while, still I did because I know what I want and it worked out perfectly but this is not enough argument for her. She thinks I lament not getting my visa and moving with Isa, which yes is something I do feel sad that it didn’t happen but because of the chance to move to a different country and have some new experiences, it was only bound to be 6 months and I would eventually come back. I feel happy with how my life worked after this and I regret nothing.\n\nI met Isa when me and my GF weren’t together and I feel she is the one making all of this weird, I understand the jealousy and I would behave similarly if there was a guy hitting on my GF and they had something, but this is not the case and it never was. Isa even returned to her ex as well because she felt the same way…\n\nAITA for wanting to keep a friend that has become special to me in my life?\n\nTLDR: I met someone when me and my GF weren’t together, we connected and became good friends, had a fling but it didn’t work out, we talked about it and remained as friends even after we both were in relationships again, now my GF gives me shit over it.\n\nAlso yes, I created the account to ask this because I would like some opinions on this.",

      "description": "AITA for sticking up for my SO and making his mother cry?\n\nSO and I are in our early 30's. Recently he has been struggling with anxiety/depression. He experiences a lot of guilt as a part of this. As a result, he has mostly stopped communicating with his family because they push him to talk about things that make him anxious and will guilt him for not calling. Its not like he's cut them out of his life, he just puts off communication until he feels ready for it, which admittedly can last a really long time.\n\nMIL eventually got fed up and decided to come for an unexpected 4 day visit. This upset me because it felt like an ambush and ultimately made SO feel worse. I try to be understanding as I know she is just worried about him, but she could have at least asked when would be a good time to visit (to me, if he isnt responding) rather than just urgently coming. The context of this visit really made him feel very out of control and embarrassed so he decided to talk to her and tell her that this trip was a violation of his privacy and wasn't ok to do. MIL claimed she had no choice, he wasn't talking to her so she had to come. Privately I felt it was very selfish of her, she came to ease her own anxieties without considering how it might make him feel.\n\nAt the end of an awkward trip, I snapped. MIL was getting ready to leave, reiterating to SO that he needs to call more and laying the guilt on heavily. She was telling him how hurt his father is that he wont call, asking if he was mad at his father?, and explaining how his father thinks he is going to die soon (he's not, but is a heavy smoker and is anticipating getting a cancer diagnosis despite not having any issues currently) and he will die thinking his son doesn't love him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI snapped, \"I'm not sure guilt is the right approach here,\"\n\nMIL: \"well then what is?\"\n\nMe: \"Patience and understanding... he's an adult\" and then I left the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely said it in a frustrated way. Up until this point I had tried really hard to be smiley + friendly, so I think that my outburst hit extra hard. Then MIL left for the airport crying.\n\nI tried reaching out to SO's sister and we had a really heated conversation in which she told me plainly that he needs to call his family. I don't disagree, but I suggested that they be understanding of what he's experiencing and allow him some space. She said his behavior indicates that either he's really rude or something is seriously wrong and when tried explaining, he doesn't want to call because his family just makes him feel bad by guilting him, she told me she was too frustrated to talk to me and hung up.\n\nIt sounds like nobody wants to hear how to help support him, they just expect him to change and I dont think thats a fair ask so I'm the villain. So AITA?",

      "description": "This story happened years ago, around when I was 17, but unfortunately is still in the back of my mind to this day.\n\na bit of background info. At the time I was, still am, a card (magic the gathering)/ comic nerd, though thankfully I have taken up working out as well. I was living with my mom and younger sister at the time this event occurred. Lastly my parents are divorced, and when I turned 16 my dad bought me a card, nothing fancy, just an old beat up ford truck from the 90's, but she was mine and fully in my name.\n\nwhenever I wasn't at home I was usually hungout with my older cousin who played cards with me, or at my local game store (LGS) playing cards, cause when you play cards who has money for drugs? Anyway at the LGS we had a lot of inside jokes, much like any other place where a select group of people my frequently gather. My mother was not one of these people, she never came into the shop to talk to people or anything, in fact she made fun of my friends frequently through-out my time there. So one day she decided that she wants to go to the mall with my sister and I. Also I had to drive us there cause her car was low on gas. I'm not one for the mall because my mother will take forever, but whatever. We all get in my truck and start to head towards the mall. not 5 minutes into the trip a random inside joke from the LGS just pops into my head and I start to laugh. my mom who was in the passenger seat looks at me asks \"what's so funny\". I didn't really wanna explain it as it was a joke you had to be there for so I simply told her \"I don't think you will get it, its an inside joke.\" she looks at my and goes \"ok..... pull over.\" I pull over to the side of the road thinking she left something at the house. she then looks my dead in the eyes and tells me to \"get out\" I was a bit dumbfounded at the time, but I thought maybe she just wants to drive, so my dumbass gets out onto the road, leaving the key in the car, and starts to walk around to the passenger side. before I can get to the door, my mom is already in the driver's side. she turns the car on and proceeds to drive off leaving me on the side of the road. I then had to break into my own house, because she took my house key too as it was on my car key ring. I called my cousin to see where he was at, gathered my things and walk to my LGS where my cousin was so I can at least be with someone for the rest of the day. My mom stole my car, locked me out of the house, and left me on the side of the road.... all because I wouldn't tell her a joke she wouldn't get.\n\nYears later this indecent is still on my mind. So I ask you all AITA here? If nothing else maybe this will give me some peace of mind to hear other's opinions on this",

I found out an artist I really like is performing 2 days after my bday, and got my excitement back up, I also found a redeemable ticket for six at a local bowling alley, and a dance workshop I have been eager to attend is happening this weekend.\n\nSo my mother is easily one of the most thoughtful people ever. when I found out I couldn’t go to the first concert (that she approved of and even unnecessarily offered to pay for) that i’ve been to since seeing the cheetah girls when I was a toddler, I handled the situation poorly. \nI was also planning to attend a free dance workshop that I had been looking forward to since the last.\nMy mother has informed me several times that I cannot do or plan anything from Friday to Monday because of this surprise she has in store for my birthday. All i know about it is that it’s gonna be me and her somewhere away from home. \nI am sure it will be great, but WHY MY BIRTHDAY WEEKEND‽ when I lost it, my mom said that she’s not gonna be able to do any of this in a few years since i’ll move away, and that she had no way of knowing I’d have plans on the weekend when she planned this, but I’m turning 16, what 16 y/o wants to go away w their mom for their birthday weekend, as my bday is on Wednesday. It’s not like it’s a 2 day thing, either, it’s from Friday to Monday.\nI think it’s sweet but inconsiderate, don’t treat me how you wanna be treated, treat me how I WANNA BE TREATED, she knows surprises that I’m aware of but unaware of what they are, is my biggest pet peeve, I just don’t know how she expected this risk of a plan to be worth it??\nI am gonna go, I asked if she could postpone or cancel it, and she said no, but then after arguing and her calling me an ungrateful brat, which I can see, but is not who I am, she said she’d just cancel the whole thing and just lose the money. I feel extremely guilty and honestly don’t want that; I just want a middle. a happy mf middle.\nI wish she didn’t see me as ungrateful, but I wish she at least acknowledged my perspective, and the fact that a risk like that is not usually gonna blow over well w a fifteen y/o girl?? i’m trying to be a good sport, but after you decide AITA, lmk what I should do.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My severely depressed husband told me that I never put him first. I told him that being emotionally supportive (and financially, since he can only hold a part time job) demonstrates my love for him. He has depressive episodes pretty much daily, usually lasting hours, during which I hold him, kiss him, make him food, and do my best to be supportive (e.g. telling him that a part time job is better than no job, and that I am proud of him). Depressed as he is, he tells me that I do not make him happy, that he hates his job, life, etc. I should mention that my husband goes to therapy regularly and takes his meds, but nothing seems to work enough to pull him up. \n\nFor me, it is so much work to remain positive and caring and supportive when depression takes over. It takes a lot of energy just to have the same conversations, day after day, about how hopeless everything is, how life is not worth living, etc. It takes a lot of energy to hear \"I am not happy with you,\" and stay strong because you know that's depression talking. Everyday, I see myself putting aside what I would like to be doing with my evening to take care of him. When I confronted with this, his response was that I knew what I was getting into, that emotional support is a core feature of a marriage, and that it does not count as putting him first. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for thinking that taking care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile?\n \n\n\n\n",

They go in there when the female isn't in use so other girls can go to the toilet.\n\nI work in an office with one other guy and six girls. I've had this problem since working here that the girls do there make up in the males toilet every morning. The first time it happened I was ok and told them to stop it but this morning I stood by the water machine to wait for them. When one of the girls was heading into the male toilet to do her make-up I got up from my desk followed her and said 'What do you think you're doing'. She tried to get out of the situation but I proceeded to not just tell her but all the females in the office that it is a male toilet and not a female and how would they feel if I went into the female toilet to shave every morning. After this charade I have been given the deadliest of evils from all these girls for the past week. \n\nWas it really ass-holey of me to block the girl and tell them off about going into the male toilet.",

She said that two rooms were too expensive and then proceeded to gush about all the fancy, expensive stuff the hotel had to offer.\n\n Now I don't mind spending time with my parents, but I'm 14 and the thought of it just made me super uncomfortable. Also my dad snores REALLY loudly and I'm a light sleeper. So I told my mum that I really wouldn't be comfortable doing that and if there were any cheaper options. She told me that it wasn't for that long and I could just wear earplugs. When I insisted, she got angry and called me \"ungrateful\" and \"petty\" and stormed out. \n\nI tried talking to her but she's been giving the cold shoulder (this always happens after we have a disagreement) and I really don't know how to go about this.

      "description": "I used to be best friends with a girl (let’s call her Bailey) up until recently. We had been best friends since 6th grade but we were friends before that in elementary school. Over the course of those years she became pretty much family to not only me but my parents as well going to family vacations with us and vice versa. Everything began to change when she started dating a boy who she had been slightly interested in on and off that also happened to be her neighbor. She has been with him for about three years now and has basically pushed our friendship to the side. Bailey has consistently blamed my other friend and I for leaving her and making other friends when she left us for a boyfriend. BUT it gets better. I didn’t permanently cut off ties with her till recently when she began cheating on her boyfriend with multiple guys and telling her boyfriend she needed a “break” and telling my friend and I thinking we weren’t going to be honest with her and tell her how it is. Despite my feelings towards her cheating i still tried to guide her through the right decisions and although I truly don’t like her boyfriend (he doesn’t talk to any of her friends and comes off very rude and antisocial) I still didn’t believe what she did was morally right. When I saw she was not going to be honest with her boyfriend and that she was going to go crawling back to him after what she had done I fell back a little. Through out our whole friendship I as well as my other friend also dealt with a lot of judgement from Baileys parents for things such as smoking weed and how my parents have raised me. I hadn’t talked to her in a couple weeks when I saw her and her boyfriend were back together for good and she texted me asking me about something she heard I was saying about her like we are 15 years old and still in high school and I didn’t even answer I just blocked her. I’m just wondering if i’m an asshole for moving on with my life and “leaving her behind” like she makes it seem like i did.",

      "description": "It's a long story so I'll give both versions.\n\nAlso warning my sense of humar can be gross so dog poop is mentioned in detail.\n\nShort version - A guy brought his twin toddlers to the dog park and was allowing them to call dogs over. His daughter calls my corgi and my corgi gives a little jump to lick her face. Her father notices the interaction and kicks my corgi and accuses her of attacking and mauling his daughter. Cops are called and realizing he's full of it escorts him and his children off premises for the day.\n\nLong version - I took my two dogs (I'll call them the girls) to the dog park every other day until my eldest had knee surgery. So this story is a little dated but has been bothering me.\n\nWe always go to the small dog area first so the girls can blow off some steam. They chase and play with children and do little jumps for kisses - both of the girls are trained and gentle but get a bit excited with children and need reminders. They don't jump on them but if a child calls them at the dog park they'll go even if I recall them they tend to stick close so its normally not a problem. \n\nOn this day Freya, my Swedish Vallhund, had stopped to potty and I was picking that nice smelly bit (I remember it to this day) when I heard a little girl call Sophie (the corgi). I didn't think to much about it since I had the biggest pile of Vallhund poop I've ever seen. I turned to see a cute little girl hugging Sophie and giggling while she got a free bath and then I was shocked when her dad kick my dog hard enough to make her flay a few feet. He started scream at me about how I needed to control my dogs and he was calling the police. I almost laughed out loud when he went through with his threat and called 911 for a dog attack. I could see my two dogs playing fetch with his son while he lied to the operator about the incident.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later a police unit and animal control get to us and ask where the injured child and dangerious animal are. The man raged about me and my girls while I calmed pointed to them, still playing fetch, with this guys kid. I'm pretty sure mental sighs happened between them as the started assessing the situation and after some taking the warned him and escorted him out of the park.\n\nI've always felt bad because his kids went through that but at the same time I didnt start it.\n\nAlso no charges were filed by me but he still got animal cruelty put against him. My Corgi was unharmed and still itching to play.\n\nPs. I wrote this whole thing on my phone I'm sorry for any issues either grammatical or otherwise. Have a great day!",

      "title": "WIBTA for breaking up with my girlfriend because of her mental health issues?",
      "description": "To preface the situation, I love my girlfriend. Very much. We have been together for over a year, and that year has been one of the best years of my life. That being said, recently, there have been more and more issues with our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur relationship started off on the wrong foot, as we started talking immediately after she got out of a bad relationship with her ex and had no time to process the breakup before we started dating. After that, the relationship was doing fine until we quasi-moved in together about eight months ago. I say it's only quasi-moving in because we both still have our own places, but we trade off where we stay every night or so. With this came all of the normal growing pains of moving in together. Getting a new live-in roommate is never easy, but we have handled that fairly gracefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the heart of the issue. Approximately 6 months ago, her mental health issues started to show up/I started to notice them. She hasn't been diagnosed, but clearly shows signs of anxiety and depression. On multiple occasions, I have sat with her and tried to console her as she had a depressive episode, and have calmed her down during a panic attack. I truly have no problem doing this, but the frequency has begun to take a toll on me. I have tried to get her to attend counseling, which she tried. She only made it to two or three sessions before she decided that it \"wasn't for her\" and that she \"didn't need it.\" Since then, her depression and anxiety has just gotten worse, and the episodes have gotten more frequent. Now, it seems like she is always mildly depressed, and is always gloomy. It has gotten to the point where she does not want to do things that she has to, like go to the store to get food because we are both out or get up off of the couch to turn the lights off. When I bring these up, she asks me to do them, always giving an excuse for why she can't do it. I try to be as understanding as I can, and help out, but like I said, I'm getting tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add to this mess, she has major trust issues that are taking a toll on our relationship. The aforementioned ex cheated on her multiple times and now she has a problem trusting anyone. Not to help that issue, there has been one incident in our relationship that has stoked the fires or jealousy. I have an ex that was on-again off-again during high school that came to the same university as I did. We have not dated in almost four years, but have remained platonic friends. Early in our relationship, I went out to eat with a group of friends and my ex was there as well. Nothing happened, but my ex did give me a ride home. I admit, this was not the best decision in the scenario, and have admitted this to my girlfriend as well. My girlfriend was very hurt by this, and we have talked about it over and over. Always with me apologizing and admitting my actions were wrong. Since then, I have cut off all communication with my ex, but my girlfriend is still jealous, and constantly thinks I am talking to her, or some other girl. Trust is a major need for me in a relationship, and I don't know if I can keep this relationship alive without her trusting me 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize, my girlfriend and I are having issues getting along, and seem to be constantly fighting over little stuff. The core of the argument always comes down to either her being jealous of someone else, or me not loving her enough. I am always in the wrong, and there is always something wrong with what I am doing or how I am doing it. I have made mistakes in the past, but have apologized and changed my actions, but that has not changed her stance on the issues. I am tired of constantly fighting, and even though we have talked about it, nothing seems to ever be resolved because we just bring it up later in another fight. But, she loves me very much, and I believe she honestly wants the best for us, and would be absolutely devastated if we broke up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWITBTA if I broke up with her because of the above issues?",

      "description": "Hello Reddit! I wanted to keep it short, but silly old me just couldn't do that apparently. \n\nLittle background information: I am 18 years old. Since around a year and a half I've been tutoring both chemistry and mathematics to classmates/fellow students as a part time job. I live in the Netherlands where from the ages 12 - 18 (ish) you would do either a VMBO, HAVO or VWO course/program (to make it really simple, VMBO is considered 'the easiest' and VWO is considered 'the most difficult' when in actuality it's a little more complex that just 'easiest' and 'most difficult'). I got my HAVO diploma a year and a half ago, and I've been in the VWO program since then and my plan is to go to university afterwards. For my central exams on the HAVO for chemistry I got an 8.9/10 and for mathematics I got an 9.3/10, this is when I got inspired to help/tutor other people (I've done it before the exams but less thorough/during class). \n\nLast july I signed myself up for a tutoring service, where both students and tutor can find eachother for a chosen subject they need help with. But since I signed myself up last july, I haven't gotten any students from them yet: no big deal, I suspect around may/april 2019 they'll come because the central exams are getting closer. I do still have students from my old school (where I am also listed as a tutor) and my mother is a teacher (music) and sometimes has students for me.\n\nNow onto last week: I got an e-mail that in my area there was a new student available, I figured I'd check out what he needed help with (students need to list that to make sure the tutor can prepare accordingly). It stated that the student was a 52 year old man that was taking the HAVO central exam may of next year, and needed help working with the graphic calculator (the classic TI-84 from texas instruments) and general help with mathematics for around 4 hours/week. I immedeatly wanted to decline the student, because I really am not comfortable going to this man's house to tutor him, even though he really needs help with the calculator. I think it's really inspiring that even though he's 52 he's willing to take the central exam and get his HAVO diploma. I waited about a week and got another e-mail (these are automatically generated btw, he did not send me the e-mail directly) and instead of leaving it be, I clicked on the \"permanently decline\" button. \n\nMind you I've never seen this man/spoken to him in person, but the sheer fact he was 52 really caught me off guard and pushed me to say no to tutoring him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to tutor this man?

      "description": "Coworker and I get along good, and she is really nice. Last year around July, she was at her highest weight (probably around 350 pounds) and had a gastric sleeve surgery done. She was out of work for a month to recover. Over the last 7 months or so, she has lost 120 pounds. \n\nSeriously - that is AWESOME. But.. in my opinion, surgery is kind of the easy way out, but she made a choice trying to better her health, and I’m proud of her for that. Personally I’ve always struggled with weight myself. At the beginning of 2019, I decided to nip it in the bud, get my shit together and do something about it. I started working out again, eating better. Over the past couple of months, I have lost 18 pounds. It’s a process, but it’s worth it. \n\nWith both of us trying to lose weight, I’ve asked my coworker if she’d want to go to the gym with me. We could buddy up and encourage each other in our weight loss journey. She doesn’t work out and still eats really bad, and as a result of losing the weight so quickly, she has a lot of extra skin. \n\nTo get to the point: My coworker is one of those people who posts on Facebook several times throughout the day, giving every little life update. If she goes out of town for the day, she’s posting every couple of hours with 15+ pictures with every post, checking in at every place she walks into. I think everyone knows someone like that. Obsessed with trying to get as many likes as she can. \n\nShe posts at least once a week about her weight loss and/or her new stomach, how little food she eats, etc. Part of me thinks I should be feeling “Yeah!! You go girl!!”, but the ‘asshole’ part of me gets kind of irritated seeing her post about it so much and so often because I know she’s trying to fish for likes. The constant side-by-side pics. It’s almost like she’s become self-obsessed, like she’s changed. At one point, her cover photo was two selfies attached to each other, plus the profile picture of another selfie. \n\nSo I don’t know, Reddit. Easy solution is obviously to unfollow her (but still remain Facebook friends). I know I can make her posts disappear on my newsfeed, but I’m not asking for a solution. I just want to know if my thought process is normal. The first few major posts about her weight loss, I was like “hell yes!!”. But it’s become so repetitive. Each post is starting to get less and less likes, and it’s like it makes her want to post more. She’s looking for constant pats-on-the-back and affirmation. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "So a bit of backstory, my friend and I have been best friends since Kindergarten. We’re freshmen in college now. Over 14 and a half years of being best friends. He moved away to a town half an hour away after 2nd grade, and went to Arizona for college before dropping out one semester in. Needless to say, we’re best friends and we’ve been through a lot. \n\nMy birthday was today, February 18th. I turned 19. He didn’t text me or reach out to me at all today. He was asking me on Sunday if I was indeed going out with my girlfriend today, which I was. So he definitely remembered about it then, but didn’t reach out at all to me today. It’s 10:30, so there’s still some time but I think he might not. I’m pretty upset over it to be honest. I don’t expect anyone to remember my birthday, but even after viewing my snapchat story which made it clear that it was my birthday, he said nothing to me. Am I the asshole for being upset over this?

      "description": "My ex and I broke up several years back now. While I am now in a safe and healthy relationship, my ex was extremely abusive. TOU forbids details. \n\nBeing around him still scares me. I still have nightmares about things that happened. I have requested to not be invited to gatherings we will be at, and I requested he not be invited over my apartment by anyone. \n\nBoth of these have been ignored. My roommate invited him over to play with guns in my living room. I have gone places to find out he was invited and was not even warned, then having to leave or stay in a small space with him panicking. \n\nPeople who know what he did to me try to say \"he's changed\", yet he went on to do the same thing to two more people. He trashed my reputation by claiming I cheated, etc., which several friends believed until he rinsed, lathered, repeated with the other two partners after me. If he's changed why is he still trying to trash all three of our reputations?\n\nI have gotten messages from people when they find out I am attending events he may go to telling me to \"behave\", even though it is known I never approach him. \n\nHe has attempted to apologize twice. The first time was for the lies he was spreading and he went right back to it. The second was a \"I'm sorry you feel this way\" and I told him to fuck off. \n\nWhich... apparently I'm an asshole for. \n\nI do resent people who know what he did to me and two other people and still call him a friend. How do I reconcile someone caring for me and being friends with someone who has done me and others grievous harm? I don't verbalize this, but it hurts. It hurts that I can't even get a warning for him being in a place so I can make an informed decision to go. \n\nI just want to have my boundaries and comfort respected in one place as much as his apparent right to do anything he damn well pleases.\n\nPeople keep saying it's not fair to make them choose. I don't understand how telling me he will be somewhere/respecting my wish of not wanting to be invited places he will be is making them choose. They say it's not fair that I'm not giving him another chance. They say it's not fair I won't forgive him. They say it's not fair I don't want him in my living space. I'm at my wit's end and am about to say \"Fuck it\" to everyone and tell them all to leave me the fuck alone. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "So to start off I have an 8 month old son. When I first found out i was pregnant I was with my sisters so ultimately they knew about it first. The reason I took the test with them was because I suspected I was pregnant and my boyfriend just brushed off my concerns. \n\nWell they told people about my pregnancy (without permission) and obviously word got around so we had to tell people much sooner than we'd liked. Now he doesnt want my sisters to visit the baby because they ruined the excitement of announcing our first baby to some people. Now, I dont excuse their actions but they are family and I have always had a very close relationship with them. \n\nThen when our son was first born, one of my cousins came to hospital without warning and was kind of obnoxious and loud. My boyfriend was trying to sleep at that time and they had woke him up. He got mad and stormed out. Ever since he has nothing good to say about her. I had the opportunity to visit her and I took it. Well needless to say he's angry with me now because i took our son to visit her. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend doesnt want me visiting family with our son. AITA for doing so against his wishes? ",

I have asked him before who he's talking to and he just turns it into a fight. He claims I'm invading his privacy but he won't ever give me an honest answer. I have tried to talk to him about it in a calm way and explain to him that it makes me feel uncomfortable that he's giving out his cell number to so many strangers. I've told him it makes me feel very insecure that he might be looking to leave me.  (I'm also 5 months pregnant) But he just says im emotional from my hormones and im acting crazy. He constantly deletes everything off his phone but tells me it's just bullshit guy talk. On our phone bill he's sent over 10,000 messages in one month period. This is making me afraid that he wants to leave me and every time we fight about his phone he says invasion of privacy and that's worth divorcing over. Please help am I in the wrong and just being hormonal or is he really being shady behind my back? We used to talk about everything now I can't get 2 words out of him. ",

I have gotten all of the new scouts attending the campout (around 20, we had a lot this year) to plan the meals. I had told them all about how this works, how I am going to buy them all the food and how the money will be taken out of their scout account, etc. Then, this new scout starts screaming about how his parents are going to bring him food, and how we don’t need to buy it for him because of his ADHD diet. \n\n\nFast forward the weekend of the campout, his parents don’t have the food.  He starts to pester me, yanking on the sleeve of my shirt trying to get me to feed him. I told him about how it was his fault he did not tell his parents about this, and how he should have made sure that he was going to get the food. Because I did not plan for him, I had to scrape together some food for breakfast from the other meals, as the other scouts have gone through all of it already.

I felt comfortable around her, and I am generally very intraverted/socially awkward with newer people. We have become reasonably close (as friends of course) over the last year.

By this I mean that I made sure not to act overtly flirtacious with her/make a move, whatever you want to call it. I genuinely do value her friendship, and obviously if she were to become single later on, I would revisit the idea of pursuing a relationship with her.

      "description": "Okay so my friend had this party tonight. I'm at home from college, living with my parents for the holidays, so I abide by their rules.\n\nThis morning I told them that I'm going to the party and they said that it was fine. I've been going out a lot this holiday, coming home at about 12am to 1am so that they could still get a decent night's sleep after opening the door for me.\n\nJust before the party tonight, my dad told me that we all had to wake up at 7am tomorrow because we had to go visit my grandma who is sick. I said that it was fine with me, and my mother said/asked to me and my dad that I'd probably had to come home from the party sooner, seeing as we'd have to wake up early. My dad then said that it wasn't a problem. I could come home \"whenever I like\" because he had a headache and was going to take 2 pills and go to bed early. When I would arrive, he'd just wake up, open the door and then go back to bed, so it wouldn't bother him.\n\nBy 3am I was still at the party enjoying myself, when my mom called. She said: \"I am still awake. could you please for once stop being selfish and come home so that we can go to bed? We have to wake up early.\" immediately kind-of pissed, I said \"sure mom I'm on my way\" .\n\n** just a note : out of my whole family I'm definitely the least selfish. For 2 whole semesters, I got by without my accounting textbooks, because they were expensive and I didn't want to ask my parents to pay for them, even though they would have bought them for me along with my other textbooks. Every time we go out to eat I order one of the cheapest meals, while my selfish asshole of a brother always orders the most expensive meal. I guess I could also order an expensive meal every time, but I feel bad and I don't like that they spend money on me, so I don't think that I'm usually selfish. However, if someone thinks that I was selfish in this situation, I would consider their opinion because I feel bad now, and I really want to know if I'm wrong in this situation. \n\nWhen I got home my dad opened the door and he just said to go to bed, and I went. He looked quite dazed so I think he was asleep till I arrived. I don't think he is mad, but after what my mom said on the phone, she's obviously pissed. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "\nBasically the title. \n\nMy fiancé is wonderful to me and our son. He really is. But there's one thing that frustrates me to no end. \n\nAnytime something goes wrong and he gets upset he walks out. No matter what. \n\nI totally understand leaving if it's a big issues and you're afraid you're going to blow up and lose your temper. I get it. You leave for a bit. You come back and work it out. \n\nBut he doesn't do this. He leaves. Then when he comes back acts like nothing happened or nothing was ever wrong and doesn't want to talk about anything.   Or he doesn't come back and I have to go get him. No matter how big or small. \n\nIt could be something as stupid as him making a joke that kind of hurts my feeling and I'll say \"Hey that kind of hurts my feelings please don't say that again.\" And that will prompt him to leave and go downstairs and not talk to me. \n\nIt frustrates me because it makes it really hard to actually work on any real problems if he refuses to talk about it or runs away anytime something happens. \n\nI wouldn't be frustrated if it only happened now and then over big things, or if he came back to work it out after the fact. He could leave every single time for all I care if he was willing to talk about it later. \n\nBut he just doesn't. He just leaves like that's the end of it and no more needs to be said or done. I sort of have to force the conversation out of him to get any kind of resolution. \n\nI've gotten mixed reviews from others if I express my frustrations. Some say I'm NTA and that it sounds childish and that I'm right to be frustrated. Others say I am the asshole because that's how he deals with his frustration/anger and I should just get over it/accept it. \n\nSo I'm asking what others think. ",

      "description": "I have a close friend who likes to send those expletive copypasta chain messages during the holidays because we find them funny. On Thanksgiving this past week she sent the \"Turkey lurkey slut\" chain message to our group chat- you can do a google search if you are wondering what the message says. \n\nLater that day i dm a joke to her that one brand of clothes is way better than another brand of clothes that she likes. she says “fk no”, and I say “fk yes”. Then she says “fk you”, and I respond “fk you, fkin bitch, turkey slut”. Before I called her a “turkey slut” it was a really lighthearted “argument”, we were just joking around. I didn’t mean any harm by it and called her that term only to reference the chain message she sent earlier that day.\n\nHer immediate response is “don’t disrespect me” and saying she doesn’t want to be called derogatory terms like that. It was so serious and direct that I thought she was joking. But she reaffirmed herself by saying “Im serious” and  “Im not joking”. I was in disbelief because I completely did not expected her react like that. So I just respond with “ok” and leave it at that. After the conversation ended I was still very confused that she would say that over a lighthearted joke like that. I understand that out right calling a girl a slut can be considered by many to be very offensive and it I have not ever done that. I felt like this was different.\n\nI wanted to know how she felt about what I said so the next day, I ask her how offended she was that I called her that. \nShe said “not really because I know you didn’t mean it. But I don’t want you to call other people derogatory terms even if its a joke, because some could get really offended”. I was still unsure how she felt so I said “You sounded pretty serious, are you sure were weren’t offended”. She says “I sounded serious so you would take it serious,” and asks me why I cared if she was offended. At this point it sounds to me like she wasn’t offended, but only said that to teach me not to say that to people. \n\nSo I tell her “if you were trying to teach me not to say that to ppl, you shouldve just said that instead of acting offended and srs about it”. In hindsight I can see now that saying this didn’t help the cause of understanding how she felt, and could’ve been seen as condescending and rude. I admit that the way I handled it was a very bad attempt at that. But to end the conversation she tells me “i was serious about it u better not fucking call me those things again. idk if you’re trying to start something but back the fuck off and watch your mouth”.\n\nBefore this, I considered her a very close friend. I had never even jokingly called her any derogatory names- e.g, slut, whore, hoe, etc. While she has sent many of those expletive chain messages and even jokingly called me a slut in the group chat once before. I believed that we had a friendship in which my joke would’ve been laughed at. \nSo reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for making my friend receive a 0 on an assignment",
      "description": "  To start, we take a course together, and a recent assignment required writing an essay to a question based off a book we were suppose to read. My friend is addicted to League of Legends. He plays it in between class breaks and up until late evening when he would cram in all his studying and homework. Well, he took priority in his STEM based courses and completely disregarded the book, reading not even a full chapter. So of course, he struggled with the essay and asked for my help after typing two sentences.\n\nI began by giving him a more in depth explanation of the essay question and offered tips on how he should go about it. He then searched up a summary for the book to get ideas but quickly asked for my thesis afterwards. I explained to him my thesis statement, and this is what he set forth to write about. Not even fully completing his introduction he asked to read my paper in which I agreed, so he could use it as inspiration or to get ideas from. I gave him my laptop for the meantime while I went to take a quick shower. Afterwards, I came back to take a look at his introduction to see that the latter half was basically a reworded version of my own. I asked him if he could finishing reading my essay soon so I could watch some anime. He then emailed my essay to himself on his own accord. Yes, I should of stopped him during the process because I saw what he was doing, but I gave him the benefit of doubt and believed that he wouldn't just merely copy me.\n\nFast forward some more, the day arrived to turn in our essays. I read my friend's essay before our professor got into the classroom and was surprised. His essay held a strong resemblance to mine in phrasing, vocabulary, sequencing, idea, etc. The only difference was the evidence.\n\nA week later, we were called into my professor's office. My friend insisted that we tell him that we worked together and that our essays were the result of discussing it with each other. That didn't sit well with me. The discussion started between the professor and us, and my friend told him what he intended to. I was quiet for a while until the professor spoke and gave us a lecture on how this type of collaboration is not prohibited. I told him everything that happened after that. My friend eventually told the truth, and the professor decided to have me rewrite my essay while my friend received a 0 and that it would be on his record.\n\nMy friend was SUPER pissed at me, told me we could have gotten away with it, that I ruined his G.P.A, that I put him at risk of losing his academic scholarship, etc. Keep in mind that the best he could get is a high C in that course now. We have not talked since then. His roommate suggests that I apologize and work things out, but I'm too stubborn on the matter. I have also been told of the amount of shit talk my friend said about me. We three planned to move in an apartment together after this year, but I don't know if that is the case anymore.",

      "title": "AITA for blocking my sister on Facebook?",
      "description": "Throwaway account since my sister is on Reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context: my sister is 27, I am 19. She married her husband, Jack, when she was 22 and I was 15. I'm not close to my sister, or Jack at all. I'd met him a handful of times and we got along fine, but I wouldn't even really say that we were friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after I added him as a friend on Facebook, my sister's husband Jack started liking all of my stuff on Facebook. Not just photos and statuses, but things that I was tagged in, or even if I said that I was 'interested' in an event. He even went and liked all of my old profile pictures. I would get texts from friends asking me why this man they didn't know was liking dozens of their photos and statuses at a time and I didn't know how to explain. I don't know what brought this on, considering we hardly ever interacted. I asked my brother about it and he found it strange, since he had a much closer relationship with Jack and Jack never liked any of the things my brother posted on Facebook, even though he posted more often than I did. When this started I was 16, and Jack was 24.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire ordeal made me uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to tell my sister or my parents because I was worried that this might cause unnecessary tension amongst all of us. In retrospect, I should've just talked to my sister about it, but it seemed petty to say that I didn't like that her husband was just liking things on Facebook. And I was 16, I didn't know how to handle this kind of situation. So I blocked Jack, but I realized that if he ever used my sister's Facebook account that he would see that I was still active and know that I blocked him. So I blocked her too. I meant to unblock both of them after awhile to see if the problem was solved, but I forgot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow fast forward to last month - nearly 3 years after all of this happened. Jack and my sister have since divorced (she found out that he had cheated on her with a coworker), and my sister discovers through my brother that I am still active on Facebook and she puts it together that I must've blocked her. After explaining the situation for the first time ever to my family, she goes ballistic and calls me a bitch for not unblocking her and telling her about Jack after they had gotten their divorce. She also takes Jack's side in the matter, saying that it was a selfish of me to find him just liking my stuff creepy. My defense was that she was already hurt by finding out Jack cheated, and had no intention of getting back with him after she found out - telling her about the liking incident would rub unnecessary salt in her wound, especially seeing as how we already barely talk to one another. I also explained that I forgot that I had blocked them, and fully intended to unblock them at one point. Needless to say she's now unblocked, but Jack's still blocked.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mentally ill mom to stop parenting me?",
      "description": "First and foremost, I'm twenty-three. My mom has had severe depression to the point where it's a genuine illness for years, and she also likely has an undiagnosed behavioral disorder (based on professional opinions from doctors). Additionally, she had a stroke a couple of years ago, which further messed with her emotions and sullied her judgement. She's a very good person, and I love her very much. We have a pretty great relationship, and usually spend about an hour or two a week talking on the phone. She's one of the few people in the world I actually seek out time with.\n\nThat being said, since I graduated high school at nineteen and therefore no longer needed her for parenting purposes, she's continued to parent me, and she treats me as though I were about sixteen or seventeen (that is to say, not needing to monitor my whereabouts constantly but still parenting me in other ways). I've been moved out with a job for several years now. My dad, who is mentally sound, has treated me like an adult for the most part since I hit eighteen, with some exceptions since I was still living with them, and once I graduated, he considered me a full-fledged adult. My mom was pretty much emotionally absent during my teenage years, and my dad believes that she is now trying to \"make up for it\" by parenting me and \"behaving like a family\". He lets me divulge information as I'm comfortable with doing so, and doesn't ask for more information than is needed. My mom, however, demands information. For example, recently, my doctor insisted I quit my job immediately for medical reasons, and so I did. I was very upset about this, of course. My parents and I trade the car back and forth, and I told my dad that he could have the car for a bit while I figured some stuff out. He was fine with this, and just said okay, for which I was grateful because I didn't want to talk about it. My mom was confused and asked why, saying she didn't understand what was going on. She asked my dad if I'd told him anything. He said no. She asked if he thought to probe about it. He said no, that I'm an adult and will tell him if I so choose. She got upset with my dad (they're going through a divorce and she is always mad at him), said that wasn't how family behaved, and called me, asking what was going on. I reluctantly explained, and she started lecturing me. I told her very firmly that I love her very much and I know she's speaking because she loves me, but that I am not a child anymore, and that as an adult, I am allowed to set boundaries, and that she is crossing them, and to please stop parenting me. She got very upset about this. Please note that this is just once instance of many. We haven't talked about it since then.\n\nI still wonder if I did the right thing. My dad thinks I did, and said \"good for you!\" when I told him about it. I don't know, though. What do you think? AITA?",

      "description": "Title may be a tad confusing but bear with me.\n\nI have been living in a flat for about a year now and so far, it has been an absolute blessing. At first, I (22F) lived with 2 guys in their early 30s. We had a great symbiotic relationship and went on great together, going out to picnics, parties, drinks etc.\n\nAll is great up until 5 months ago, when the main tenant of the house (one of the two flatmates), let's call him Dimitri, announced that he'd be renting out the small spare room to some guy, as a favor to the local Catholic priest. Dimitri has strong ties with the church, and always helps out in any way possible despite not being particularly religious (something to do with the church's influence in the Greek community of the Dutch city we live in. I, my flatmates and this new guy are all Greek).\n\nApparently, this guy is in his early 50s and works as a church restorator. So far so good, I was even excited since I like the topics of restoration, refurbishing etc. Dimitri says that this guy will be staying with us for about a month, and will mostly be using the room to sleep, as he's too busy working in the church. For the purposes of the piece, the guy will from now on be referred to as Smelly Bastard (SB for short)\n\nThe day comes when SB comes by to collect the keys. I am in the kitchen doing my thing when suddenly a cloud of b.o. enters the room, followed by my flatmate and some organic blob. His longitude and latitude are at a 1:1 ratio, seemingly comprised of 1 large orb for a body, and one slightly smaller orb for the head. All face and head hair seem to have migrated towards his chest, leaving his head completely textureless. He does not acknowledge my presence, as he is too busy stating his opinion on why the Greek economy crashed (apparently the Germans' fault)\n\n1 month became 2 months, and 2 months became 3. The move-out date kept getting pushed to later dates, with excuses about his project not being finished yet. At this point, it has been 5 months. He is contributing minimally on rent and house supplies, his room stinks from meters away, and he never helps clean. The other flatmate took this opportunity to move in with his girlfriend, so now it's just Dimitri, me and SB. \n\nDespite his blatant apathy for basic hygiene, having no manners, and his refusal to understand how to use a toilet brush, my one request for SB is not to smoke in the house (it's been a house rule since before I moved in). All other flatmates and guests have respected this house rule, except for him. He decides that it's better to crack an opening and smoke through the kitchen window, which not only makes the kitchen smell bad, but it also makes it cold in the house. I have repeatedly asked him directly and through Dimitri to stop doing this, but he refuses to comply.\n\n2 weeks ago, I went to the kitchen and found him smoking again. The conversation went a bit like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: Don't smoke in the house, you should go outside.\n\nSB: It's cold outside\n\nme: Go smoke outside\n\nSB: I'm not taking directions from you, It's cold outside\n\nme: You should wear some pants and go smoke outside (he insists on wearing bermuda shorts at all times)\n\nSB: Leave me alone, I'm not going outside\n\nme: You're going outside\n\nSB: No\n\nAt this point, I am on the brink of a mental breakdown, so our voices keep getting louder until we are both shouting\n\nme: Everyone in this house respects this rule but you. YOU ARE RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL, AND YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US\n\nSB: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? \n\nme: YOU'VE OVERSTAYED YOUR WELCOME, YOU HAVE NO RESPECT AND YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DIMITRI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHURCH.\n\nSB: HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT\n\nme: GO FUCK YOURSELF\n\nSB: NO U\n\nAt that point, Dimitri gets involved to try and figure out what happened, and I state that either SB finally leaves, or I will, all the while SB is making comments about me having a bad upbringing, mentioning how my parents did a shit job at raising me etc.\n\nDimitri agrees with me that SB has overstayed and smells fucking horrible, and has agreed to kick him out in early February, but is upset with me for not having controlled myself better in that situation. I know I have been an asshole to the SB, absolutely no regrets there, but AITA towards Dimitri, for completely losing my shit on SB and not maintaining composure to keep a cool atmosphere in the house?",

I am also the main contractor with the landlord. \n\nMy flatmate recently started inviting people over and having little party’s in the living room. Although I am doing the same occasionally I am really uncomfortable with several people I have never met before just sitting in my livingroom and using my stuff.

      "description": "So this all started about two weeks ago, I had finished a personal art piece in the rdr2 art style and posted it on my Facebook. I talked to my older brother about it and he agreed that he would commission me a portrait in the same style.\n\nBefore we even negotiated prices he immediately asked for all sorts of ridiculous requests such as a dynamic background and accessories to be added. I'm normally ok with that as that's part of the process however he wanted this all to be done within a few days to which I told him \"that's not exactly possible\" as work like this can take me 10+ hours to complete. \n\nAs I was nearing finals week this would get even more difficult for me because of more projects and exams to work on in addition to the other commissions I've had in progress. My brother heavily insisted that I make his a priority even though he had yet to pay me anything in advance and insisted upon paying me after I finished the product. If anyone knows anything about choosing beggars, you'll know where this is going.\n\nNow the standard practice for art commissions is that you either pay by the hour or you pay half up front and half upon completion. I originally quoted him at around $70 but then soon after I dropped it to $20 as a gift for Christmas. He agreed to the $20 dollars and said that he'd post it to his instagram and promote me for my efforts. I figured that this is reasonable however he still wouldn't pay me half up front and demanded I finish it first before paying me. \n\nAbout 75% into the project I get a notification from my other brother who tells me that he's already posted the unfinished product online without crediting me or anything like that. Furious, I considered dropping the project all together but I needed the money to get home after finals. \n\nSo we get to yesterday and he calls me after not speaking to me for two days about my progress on the picture and why I haven't updated him on anything. I promptly told him that I'm not working on anything else until he pays me what I'm owed. I also called him out on the blatant disrespect for my work by posting an unfinished product without crediting me online. \n\nHe then proceeded to call my work mediocre and half assed to which I told him to fuck off and take it for free. I promptly hung up but he decided to call me back calling me an asshole for getting mad at him. I tried to tell him where he went wrong but he didn't want to hear it. \n\nAbout an hour later he sent me the $20 and called me an asshole for arguing with him. I ended up finishing the piece yesterday night and sent it to him along with an apology to which he still hasn't responded. I checked his instagram and it's currently his most liked picture with over 1,000 likes and my name is no where in sight, not even my signature. \n\nAll in all, I just want to know am I the asshole for calling him out and telling him to fuck off for disrespecting me? \n\n",

My girlfriend and I were sad to hear him go, but we were happy for him because hes doing the right thing for his family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago, my girlfriend told me she wanted to move in with him because she didn't want to be away from him.

That i can't just uproot my life and move halfway across the country. She told me I was being an ass and not looking at it through her lense. I'm just at a loss of what to do.

      "description": "So a little background. I spent New Years at my girlfriend's house with her parents. At some point during the night, I mentioned coffee and how I like a  local grocery chain's K Cups as they are fairly cheap and taste fine (I'm not a coffee snob). Because of that fact, I stocked up last week when they were on sale and as a result have somewhere north of 400 K Cups. This is enough to last me 5-6 months. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, and my girlfriend and I went to her parents' house for dinner. After dinner, her parents presented me with two 96 packs of the same K Cups. And the receipt with the price for the coffee circled. While it was only around $50 (the normal price, not the sale price), I told them thanks but I had stocked up while they were on sale and that I did not want them and that they could return them (the store is 45 minutes out of my way so I didn't really want to make the trek just to return them). At this point, her parents called me ungrateful. I told them that I appreciated the thought but just did not need them at this point. The money isn't an issue but the fact that they thought they bought them for me and expected me to pay for them when I didn't ask for them is what bothers me. My girlfriend says I should have just given them the money for them and take them. I disagree. Am I the asshole?",

But ive been feeling bad about since she obviously really likes them. \n\nTo be clear, she had one pair, and bought to pairs since ive been dating her.

      "description": "Firstly I don’t know anything about trading and am just going off various YouTube videos and articles.\n\nTwo of my friends have recently signed up to IMarketsLive (IML) and have spent over £500 between them so far. I looked up this business online and it seems that they are just a scam and run as some sort of pyramid scheme ( If you have two friends sign up they don’t charge you the £100 monthly fee) and it seems really sketchy. The more I looked into this the worse things looked and when I confronted them about it they seemed to dismiss these things and say the people just weren’t trading properly and expected it to happen overnight. One works full time so he can spare this sort of money however the other is a uni student and is always short on cash. I thought by bringing it up in our group chat I would be able t show them that it wasn’t a good idea and they are spending a lot of money unwisely, one of the guys didn’t take it well and says I’m stopping him trying to make money in a different way and stopping him from bettering himself and now wont come out for social occasions and had a huge argument with me where we both said things we shouldn’t have and I can see it being a problem in my friendship group.\n\n(All the money is what I’ve been told by other people not 100% accurate)",

      "description": "First time posting on reddit, nice to meet everyone! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I have 2 weeks off from school to study. I spent half just deep cleaning my house in neglected areas that don't receive regular touch ups by the family. It was very productive and threw out about 5-8 black garbage bags in the span of a week, donated 3 large boxes of knick knacks and clothing and the rest was recycled. \n\n\\*Junk I threw out had categories: expired food, excess plastic containers, and stuff that can be replaced by reusable items we already had.\\*\n\nSounds great? Well here comes the onslaught. \n\nI was cleaning the hallway where everyone walks but I almost dislocated a toe after stubbing previously (it hurts when I bend I got it checked and got  sprained diagnosis) because there was so much stuff it took up 1/4 of the walking space.  It's not stacked neatly and has irregular corners poking out. I got blamed for not cleaning but none of it is mine nor did I place it there. So during my break I cleaned it and now there are only 3 sorted bins in the corner of the hallway. Mom went ballistic and started to accuse me of throwing out precious expensive things of hers and was just pure shouting. I yelled back \"hey I gave you a week to see what I was going to do with the stuff and keep anything of importance to you in the open living room\" and \"the house is so messed up and it's all your 'stuff' \" \n\nNot gonna lie but my kindness was tested and if I replied quieter it wouldn't have been heard y'know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom was poor so I understand the need to keep things because of past scarcity but now I pay the gas bill and buy my own things so it gets overwhelming to live in a space where things just pile up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave her 4 years to clean these spaces and I now have the mental strength to do it myself. Also dad approved of the trash being thrown out so I was surprised at the outburst from mom.\\* I have consulted with a psychologist on how to approach a hoarder when throwing out large amounts and deescalate when they feel anxiety.\\*\n\nAITA for making her go ballistic and sad?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** Mom is a diagnosed hoarder, refuses to deep clean so I spent 1 week cleaning myself, found dead bugs almost cried myself and got shit from mom for days.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nMy little brother has been married for a few months now. His wife is great, super sweet, down to earth, I love them together. But I would really like him to ditch her on April 26th. \n\nAvengers Endgame is coming. Me and my brother have watched nearly every Marvel movie in the theater together (only missing Infinity Was because I had moved out of town, didn't find a job, and couldn't afford to drop in for a visit). \n\nFriends and family have accompanied us, of course. But he and I have been the the only constants surrounded by the changing faces of people who come and go in our lives. \n\nNeedless to say, with the span of the MCU, we've been watching these movies way before he began dating his wife. \n\nNow I'm not one to ever think that someone is \"stealing my brother me\" and I don't ever try to get between them. But I'm trying to buy advanced tickets to the movie so that we can go on opening night. I didn't assume that we would go alone, we spoke about it and I told him that we should go by ourselves and then we'll go again with his wife, our mom, and friends. He agrees.\n\nFine.\n\nCut to two minutes ago, I'm telling him how I'm short on cash and I'm gonna pull out a payday loan to buy these tickets (I didn't realize the tickets might go on sale soon).\n\n*He asks me to buy three* \n\nI start shaking my head and he responses with a \"fine then I don't wanna go\". \n\nHow could I not be pissed? We've seen movies without her before, its not even something she's super into? But he started getting defensive. I told him I don't want to watch it with him at all anymore.\n\nAt this point, even if he decides to go with me alone, how can I not feel shitty for asking him to ditch his wife? I know their newlyweds and this may be an attachment thing. But no matter what, I have a super guilty conscious, and I know its gonna muddle up a night that, otherwise, would have been amazing. AITA?\n\n(TL;DR I want to watch Endgame with my brother alone to complete the tradition we've had, he wants to bring his wife, I don't want him to)",

      "title": "AITA for not extending an invite to someone I don’t like?",
      "description": "Throwaway because I don’t actually have a Reddit account. \n\nSo a little backstory, my friend group has this one kid, who we’ll call A, who I just don’t get along with. We are friendly most of the time when we need to be, but we disagree on a lot of things so we butt heads a lot. He’s incredibly pretentious and likes to belittle people. If you like a song and he doesn’t or vice versa, he’ll use his musical background as proof that your opinion is *wrong*. I stress that he will literally tell you you’re wrong for having a different taste in music. I have a laundry list of things he’s done that annoy me (no really, I have a list written down in my phone) but we won’t get into that right now. One additional detail, I’ve never been invited to anything of his, we only ever hang out when someone else in the group organizes it. \n\nSo recently I invited a few of my friends from this group (the 3 that are like my best friends) to hang out at my house and do what we do, nothing crazy fun or anything. They agreed to come and we planned on going out for dinner and a few beers before heading to my house. One friend, we’ll call B, says “by the way A is coming.” He knows we don’t get along, as it is very much not a secret. I replied with “ok that’s fine, but he’s not coming to my house.” He just didn’t respond as the group chat had already moved on. Once we’re all at dinner, B texts me and asks “don’t you think it’s a little fucked up to not extend the invite to A since we’re all heading there after this?” And I said “Did you already invite him? It’s not like he has to know.” And B says “no I didn’t but he’s going to ask what we’re doing after this and it might get awkward.” So I said “well you invited him here after we made all the plans so I thought you might have thought about that ahead of time when I told you he can’t come to my house.” He gave me an annoyed look from across the table and it stopped there. (Quick notes that A was with other people that were not coming to my house, so it’s not like we were just going to ditch him all alone. I would have been ok with all of these people except A joining, but didn’t invite them or  even bring it up to avoid the awkward situation). \n\nWe left, and they didn’t even ask as that half of the group had plans as well. It could have all ended there and been over with. After we went to our separate cars B called me to tell me how rude I am and it’s fucked up that I wouldn’t invite him. I said I just wanted you guys to come chill I didn’t want to invite a bunch of people and especially not him. I shouldn’t be forced to deal with somebody I don’t get along with at my own house if I don’t want to. He got madder and said he’s going to hang out with A and the other kids instead so I said ok that’s fine and my 2 other fiends came over and we had a great time. \n\nSo, AITA for not inviting this kid to my house? He wasn’t involved at all until B invited him to dinner knowing the plan for afterwards, knowing we don’t get along, and knowing I didn’t want to invite him. I honestly feel bad at all and feel that my actions were totally justified. Could be wrong. ",

      "description": "Okay so context! My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it’s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i’m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he’s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i’m now aware that he’s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that’s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here’s the big issue. I’ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It’s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it’s just plain weird to me. I’ve cried about it all week because I can’t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn’t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don’t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it’s something I need to deal with on my own. It’s killing our relationship because he now says I should’ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "First to clarify, the sickness isn't lifethreatening or anything (I wouldn't give a shit about this if he was in worse straits). He's been coughing with a sore throat and a mild fever, but pretty happy to get some days off work and is in general   \n high spirits. When he initially got sick, we joked we'd have to quarantine him because I have an important day at university next Monday that involves speaking for quite a while, and he agreed to get a sick mask to wear and to not share anything with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last week however, he's done literally nothing to stop germs spreading. He didn't get any mask or any sort of sick gear despite me asking twice, he grabbed a bunch of our shared dinner chips with his bare hands even though tongs were right there, he's coughed without covering his mouth in our kitchen twice and later he coughed in his hand and then opened up the fridge with said hand (!) At first I asked politely for him to wash his hands and joked about it, but he's literally done the opposite of everything he was supposed to do and I got irritated. I started asking more often and he would reply more angrily to leave him alone and he wasn't a child\n\nLo and behold yesterday I have a massive headache and fever with what feels like the beginning of a sore throat which has persisted into today. I told him he could have tried harder to not spread it to me and he called me a neat freak who's \"been riding his ass all week over nothing\" and is now giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I too much of a nag? I feel like he could have at least attempted to be more hygienic. ",

      "description": " I am 26 years old and currently at the point in my life where I have an established career in the city I live in and happen to live in a one bedroom apartment by myself.\n\nSometimes, friends from out of town will tell me that they’re coming to visit my area and ask whether I would be open to hosting them. \n\nI’ve hosted people before, and find that it involves a lot of physical and mental labor. Often times, I have to be the one to not only wash/clean/prep my apartment for their arrival, but also drive them around, pay for meals as the host or cook them meals, pick up from airport/drive to airport, clean up/wash sheets afterwards, etc. Doing stuff like this is exhausting and also financially a strain.\n\nI live in a one bedroom that is very small and the only place that a guest could sleep in is on the small sofa, which I imagine is not that comfortable. I don’t even have space for a dining table, so I eat on the coffee table. My bathroom isn’t the nicest (apartment needs to be renovated) as well.\n\nOne friend from another state told me that she was close by to my city, only 3 hours away, visiting another friend. She brought up the prospect of visiting me, with the assumption that I would be hosting. \n\nShe gave me a one week notice, I’m sure she has known about this trip for a while but we didn’t arrange for anything on my end.\n\nShe hinted that her friend was encouraging her to visit me for 2-3 days so that she can get out of his house for a bit. (She’s visiting him for 2 weeks.) \n\nWhen she originally asked, I said that I would be open to hosting her. However, upon giving this more thought, I’m having doubts and don’t want to go through all the work of hosting her. If she were to arrange her own accommodations, I would love to spend quality time with her!\n\nWIBTA If I told her that I wouldn’t be available to host? I can brainstorm some alternatives but I’m sure she’d be disappointed. Thank you for reading my post! ",

From day ONE she complains to me about how he ignores her texts and parties with other girls! So obviously after a few months I’m more than a little annoyed with this guy. \n\nAfter a particularly bad episode where she runs away from home to cry in a park by herself at night, she calls me because her boyfriend won’t console her or even call because he’s hanging out with friends. Fed up, I message him and ask him what the hell is up for him to leave his girlfriend when she’s been crying nonstop. He turns on mE and accuses me of barging in on their relationship and not knowing anything about it.\n\nHun for seven months she calls me after arguing with you and I’M the one that doesn’t know anything?? Then he’s playing the victim saying that he needs space from her and that I’m not accomplishing anything by talking to him him. But right after I message him, he finALLY calls her to talk.\n\nMind you, this whole time his girlfriend knows what I’m saying and checks off anything I send. She’s even saying that she’s planning on dumping him after this.\n\nThen, by the end of the night he apologizes and she takes him back! Never mind the fact that he was more concerned that someone was calling him out than his girlfriend’s emotional health\n\nTL;DR Friend is angry at boyfriend, I chew him out in her place and she knows every word I’m saying, but boyfriend says it’s not my place and I don’t know anything about their relationship",

      "description": "Tldr; my gf says she is too young to settle down with 1 guy for the rest of her life. She really likes getting attention from other guys. A guy tried to kiss her but she said no, because she loves me, but she also said she really wants to be able to kiss people when she is out clubbing. Am i an asshole for saying no i don't want you to kissother people.\n\nMe and my girlfriend, both 22, are going through a rough time. I know that happends to all of us. We have been together for a year and half now. In the beginning we were madly in love (still are, kind of). After some time together she admits to me that she is not ready to settle down. Before you ask, i did not propose to her. \n\nLet me paint the picture first. \nShe used to party very hard, like every weekend. She has hooked up with so many people that she can't go out clubbing without meeting a former \"lover\". She stopped partying over time, before and after i met her. So I did not put an end to it. She likes tk go out to dance, and i've never stopped her.\n\nMe, i am not a very social guy, i rarely go out, i have few and close friends. I am also a VERY jealous guy. She is my second relationship. The first girl tried to use me to get pregnant and cheated on me. So I have some trust issues with girls. I am working on that.\n\nAfter about 8 months or so together she confesses to me that she is not ready to settle down. We are only 21/22 years at the time. So i think fuck it, we're young i don't wanna stop her from living her life how she wants it. We agree on an open relationship. We love each other, but can hook up with others. She with a couple of people some times and i'm REALLY FUCKING JEALOUS. I never got with anybody because when she found out i was talking to a girl she was on the verge of crying, and became jealous just by me talking to other girls. I never really had to intention to be with anybody else because of trust issues and i never was. After about 2 months we end the openrelationship because we are both too jealous people to cope with it.\n\nWe are now exclusive and that's how i want it and she too, kind of. Time goes by and she admits she misses the attention she got when she was single. We talk and both agree that if she is out clubbing she is allowed to talk to and dance with other guys. That is fine with me. \n\nTonight she told me that she was out with a friend. She talked with a guy and danced with him for hours. And then he tried to kiss her. She stopped him. Atleast she said she did stop him because she loves me. But then she said she only did it because it was the right thing. She said she was captivated with him, not in love but kind of flattered. She tells me she really wants more. She has said that for her, kissing/making out with guys is for her an appropriate way to thank them for being nice, flirting, dancing with her etc.\n\nShe likes getting attention, the kind that makes her feel good about herself. I know getting compliments on your looks feel better from somebodyelse than your boyfriend who calls you beautiful every day.\n\nI told her that im not happy with her if she kisses other guys. I even told her i might end our relationship if there cant be just us 2. And we disagree. She did nothing with the guy as far as i know. She is about 1000 kilometres (600 miles?) away visiting a friend and that is where all this happened. Am i the asshole for telling her no to kiss other guys?",

      "description": "First of all, I know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?",

      "description": "My (24F) fiance (26M) continually get in arguements over this and idk, maybe I am being an asshole. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nI currently attend University, work part-time, and take care of our 2-year-old. He works full time, 53 hour weeks. \n\nWhen we first got pregnant we discussed it and decided it would be best for me to quit working and focus on school full-time, taking care of the baby, and taking care of the house while he took care of all of the bills. We also decided at this time that when I graduate we will be moving to another country and need to start saving up for our Visa/money to live off of at first. We put together a budget that was tight, but still left him with several hundred dollars a month for spending money.\n\nAround 6 months go by and the gas/electric are about to get shut off, rent has been late every month, and my savings I had previous has been drained trying to keep up on the bills for him because he \"needs\" $15 in crap from the gas station every morning and \"needs\" to buy lunch for the entire office everyday (which, no. He doesn't). I'm stressing out because I always paid my bills early and we really need to save so I went out, found a job that works with my schedule (only open while daycare is open so he doesn't have to watch the baby, willing to work around my class schedule) and began working so that we could, you know, pay the damn bills. \n\nHe's upset. I did this without discussing it with him, and \"Who will take care of the house!?!?\" I told him that paying for the damn house should take precedence, and I would actually like to have a tiny bit of spending money now and again as I was never given anything before, unless he was in a really good mood because \"why would I want to give you money if I'm upset at you\". This is like $10-$15 that I would ask for an entire 1-2 weeks.\n\nEver since then if the house isn't spotless, he gets mad and tells me I need to quit. He has to change a diaper? I need to quit. His dog that he brought home without discussing needs a bath and I didn't do it? I need to quit. I've ate 2 hotdogs in the past 3 days because I've been working so much at my job and to get ready for finals and make sure I get the baby picked up on time and taken care of and I have no money for groceries or food because literally every dollar plus $10 I didnt have went to bills. He has his entire weeks pay on cash and so I asked for a little money so I could buy some food today. Once again it was \"Why would I give you money if I'm upset at you? If you didn't work you'd have time to take care of your house duties and I wouldn't be upset and you could go to the grocery.\"\n\nIdk. I'm at my wits end. I thought I was in the right but now I'm really starting to question myself. Maybe I am really being an asshole about the whole thing and asking for too much.\n\nTLDR: I want to work, Fiance says I need to quit and take care of baby/house better. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My friend and roommate has an obvious eating disorder. She shows symptoms of binging, restricting, and over exercising. She is at a healthy weight right now but she is still obsessed with losing weight. \n\nI know a lot about the subject, I'm involved in the health/fitness scene. I have tried to talk to her about it and she brushes me off. I didn't know what else to do, so I told her parents. We kind of had a sit down meeting about it. She didn't talk much, just listened and said she would have to think about everything. \n\nI stepped out to hit my vape pen for awhile and then she came out and was pissed. She said she didn't have an eating disorder and that I ruined her life. Apparently her parents want her to go to the hospital. She was screaming at me and then drove off. This happened earlier and she hasn't come home yet. \n\nHer parents are glad I told then but my other friends think it was a dick move. My boyfriend said I was nosy and just wanted to start drama, but I'm really concerned about my friend...",

She was quite excited about it and we have arranged to go this saturday night. I am quite excited about it as well, as she seems like an amazing person.\n\nHowever, last night, I was talking with another female friend who went out with one of my friends, and she has been quite down after some events happening between them. She feels 'used' by him, and after hearing he might be getting back in with his ex, was quite upset by it. I said I'll try to meet up with her (before my date) and just make sure she is doing well, but I'm worried that by doing this, it would be really disrespectful to the girl I asked out. So, WIBTA for going out with this girl to make sure shes doing alright, after having asked the other girl on a date? Should I possibly mention it to the girl just so she understands why I'm going to meet her and doesn't take it the wrong way?",

      "description": "I’ve been with this group of online friends for 4 years now and we all play League of Legends. There are 8 of us in total and for the past 4 years I’ve gifted each of them a skin (around 5 bucks per skin ) on their birthdays and Christmas. My friends would do the same except “Jane”. \n\nJane hasn’t played League in over a year. She logged on once on Christmas Day and was annoyed that I gave everyone else a gift on Christmas except her. Her birthday was 2 days ago and she logged on. I assume I’m the only one who didn’t gift her a skin because she called me out for being selfish. But over the course of a year she has only logged on twice.\n\nThe thing is Jane has never ever spent even a penny on anything for my birthday or Christmas. Not even a “happy birthday” or “thank you so much for X thing”. There was one time we’re we all went to meet up and everyone brought gifts for each other. I got personalized shot glasses for everyone. Jane didn’t bring a single gift for anyone.\n\nShe then talked to her BF, who’s in our group, about how I’m selfish and he confronted to me about it privately. I pointed out that he spent $500 on a Valentine’s Day gift for her and she gave him a $10 name change as a gift. I told him Jane puts herself before everyone else and that I’m not obligated to give gifts to people. Especially since Jane doesn’t even play the game anymore. Now, Jane is just showing off her gifts from her BF on our group chat and passively throwing shots at me. So, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Writing from mobile on a throwaway, and yes I see how you could read the title and immediately think I’m an asshole, but hear me out. My girlfriend (17) has a very bad home life, she lives in a super run down house, was taken out of school very early for “religious” reasons, and is abused often by her siblings and dad. She lives in a house with her mom, her dad, and her 5 siblings, they are very poor and live off of food stamps. That’s never been a problem for me as I don’t judge her based on her wealth, but it becomes a problem for me when I realize she hates it there and claims everyone in her family hates her and treats her terribly.\n\nWhere her mom comes into this is that her mom is the only person she cares about (other than me, according to her) and her mom has really bad stomach cancer. Being as poor as they are, they can’t afford treatment for her, so my girlfriend is stuck watching her mom die slowly, I’ve offered to let her move out of her house and move in with me when she turns 18, but she doesn’t want to leave her mom. She says her mom is the only person that loves her there and they share a deep connection which is understandable, but her mom also told her it was “too late” to report the man who raped her when she was 10, so from my perspective my girlfriend seems to care so much more about her mom than her mom does her. I have always been middle to upper class and would be able to provide a better life for my girlfriend and she wants that, but she says she has to wait till her mom passes, so am I the asshole for hoping that she passes sooner rather than later? I just want my girlfriend to be in a better environment that she deserves. ",

      "description": "My wife is a PhD student, and I work full time. The overwhelming majority of our income comes from my job. We are in our 30’s, have tons of debt, and have basically nothing saved for emergencies or retirement. The only way out of this situation is for both of us to maximize our wage earning potential (while obviously cutting expenses as well), and for my wife that means finishing her PhD ASAP.  Currently she is taking on one graduate level TA position and teaching one undergrad course per semester. Her ability to access positions varies dramatically from semester to semester. The amount they pay her is outrageously minuscule. (Not her fault, she deserves more.)\n\nDuring the semester she always tells me she is too busy to work on her dissertation, and that she will work on it during the next summer/winter break. \n\nThis summer we took a two week vacation overseas. Before you tell me how stupid that is, keep in mind that for the three weeks preceding and following the vacation I worked 60-70 hours a week to pay for the lost income and travel expenses. The first few days of the trip were an academic conference my wife participated in. \n\nSo when we got home, I went back to work and she spent another two weeks watching the World Cup with friends. She openly admits she did zero work during that time. She told me the reason she chose academia was so she could have her summers off, and that the World Cup doesn’t happen often so I should cut her a break. \n\nThe day after Christmas  she told me she won’t be working on her dissertation till after the New year. She said her end of semester crunch and the holidays were exhausting and she needs a break.  \n\nI need a break too, but I have a job and bills. I don’t have that luxury.  I told her she is taking advantage of me. She said that I had more days off per week over this past semester than her. This is true, but I work 12-14 hour shifts. Three days off per week still means a 50 hour work week. \n\nAm I wrong to tell her she is taking advantage of me?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So I just got a new couch this summer and it was $250. My roommate also decided to take in a cat that isn’t hers and didn’t ask me if I was ok with it. I literally just walked in one day and there was a cat. \n\nWell, she hardly ever gets the cats nails trimmed and didn’t buy a scratching post for the cat either. So naturally, the cat scratches the furniture. I noticed the cat started to scratch my furniture so I bought a scratching post for a cat that isn’t even mine to preserve my furniture. The cat never used the scratching post. Sadly, all the furniture in the apartment is mine so my brand new couch is completely scratched up meaning that I will never be able to resell it. My reclining chair in the apartment was destroyed by the cat as well. \n\nI have a hard time with confrontation but she’s been a horrible roommate even without the cat here. I think with the two pieces of furniture that her cat destroyed (I bought both the couch and recliner for $350) I feel like she owes me at least $100 for my almost brand new furniture being destroyed. I don’t even want to use the couch when i move out because it looks THAT bad. I feel bad because she doesn’t have a job so she has very little money anyways, but she has plenty of free time as well. Would that be unreasonable to ask for compensation?\n",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nI (28f) have never been close with my sister (30f). As kids we didn’t get along or play together. As teenagers we only had a Don’t snitch on me and I won’t snitch on you type relationship. I became a mom at 16 and my sister helped me a lot with babysitting when I didn’t have daycare. I always expressed my gratitude. Gave a speech at my graduation about how much I loved and appreciated her, couldn’t have graduated without her help, even bought her Mothers Day gifts for years bc she had been like a second mom to my kids. Well I stopped years ago. \n\nAfter I graduated what little relationship we had disappeared. I always wanted to be close with her but she’d hardly ever budge. Didn’t come around. Could never get ahold of her. Growing up she always acted like she was better than everyone else. Was very judgmental. Acted snobby and short and rude to me and everyone else. She could never be bothered to do anything for anyone unless we paid her. \n\nFast forward to now. 6 months ago I almost died and was in the hospital for a couple weeks. My brother who lives 2000 miles away called. My sister who lives an hour away never showed up to the hospital, never called, never texted. After leaving the hospital I started caring for our handicap mother. I was overwhelmed already and needed help with our mom. I asked my sister multiple times to please come over, even if just for a couple hours one or two Saturdays a month so I could have a break and spend time with my kids. Nope. She can’t. She won’t. She doesn’t have time. I tell her I can pay her $200. She magically makes time. \n\nAfter that I told my mom I’m done. I love my sister but I’m done crying and hurting over trying to have my sister when she hasn’t acted like family for the past 6+ years. I’m done feeling judged by her for so long. Done with her being rude and looking down her nose at me. Done having to pay her just to be a part of her life. As it stands we haven’t spoken in months. She’s getting married in October and I don’t want to go. I don’t want anything to do with her now. I’m just done. But my dad and grandparents are giving me shit for it saying I need to get over it and go bc she’s my sister. So you tell me, AITA here? ",

The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn’t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn’t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I’m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part.

      "description": "She and I have been classmates for around 3 years but never really started talking until last year. About three months ago I found out she had depression and I told her I would try my best to help her to overcome this tough time. Recently everyone that had been close to her left (I mean her family, all her best friends stopped talking to her) leaving me to try and help her alone. \n\nTo be completely honest, I too felt really tired and thought about stopping a month ago because no matter how much I talked to her, her condition never improved. But I didn't because I thought it would be really mean and I should at least try my best to see her be happy again, so I continued to stop her from trying to commit suicide etc. \n\nI've advised her to go to the doctor regularly and she did a couple of times. I talk to her for hours into the late hours and researched on how to do so I don't trigger her again. Her condition has only become worse and worse and recently she told me that she has been trying to suicide every night. Every time she talks to me it makes me feel depressed too because everything she sends me something it's \"I tried to kill myself again last night\" or \"I'll stab myself if it makes everyone happy\".\n\nI understand that her condition is very serious at the moment but I'm just feeling so so exhausted. This morning she sent me another message saying that she's gonna kill herself. I know I will feel very sad if she actually commits suicide but on the other hand I'm thinking of just ignoring all her messages so I can live my life again.",

This time we've been together just over a year and I thought things were going quite well. We recently took a short holiday together and haven't had any major issues.\n\nThe one thing that makes me question the relationship with her is that she is not typically interested in being intimate and is almost completely inexperienced with most things sexual. Basically meaning we don't have sex. It's disappointing and frustrating for me as I'm the opposite.\n\nShe's also quite shy and introverted, often forcing me to speak to staff for her at a restaurant for example. This also means she has no interest in going on nights out with me or friends which is probably our biggest personality clash.\n\nI've recently made friends with a coworker I've known for a few months who is great company, she's funny, attractive and outgoing. We went out with some other people from work a few weeks ago where she got quite flirty. Since then we've talked more and I think I'm starting to develop feelings for this girl.\n\nI'm at a crossroads and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. Please set me straight.",

      "description": "TL;DR\nBought carpet from friend. His one tenant is a carpet/floor installer. After 18 months, they delivered carpet, but people drove on my back yard, without permission ripping up grass. \n\n\n Friend bought a new store and everything inside including a lot of carpet. I bought some of that leftover carpet. He rents out part of it to a carpet/flooring guy “Carl”. \nHe suggests asking the other guy Carl, who is a carpet person if he can deliver to me, without doing install. I ask Carl, who says yes. About $80 for delivery (I think it’s about 10 rural miles one way). I ask him when he can deliver, he says to let his assistant let him know. Long story short, 18 months later he finally is the one to reach out to me, this morning. “Can I deliver in 45 minutes &amp; what’s your address”, I say yes. \nAbout 90 minutes later call from his assistant “what’s your address”\nMy intent was to help Carl, move it from the driveway to the basement using external door. It’s about 65 feet from driveway to basement. And tip Carl 5 bucks for having to move it semi far (can’t just drop off in garage). \n10 minutes later I hear a car in the driveway. It’s not Carl, but helper dude #1 &amp; #2. I meet him outside. He asks where it’s going, I show him the basement. He says “is this the only way in” to which I say “the back is a bit flatter” (the grass is wet from rain&amp; front is definitely more of a hill downward slope). \nHe says okay. I go inside to debate with the wife if I should give them a 5 to split, 5 singles, or 5 each. She says I should tip 5 each. As I go to grab another 5, I see they have just driven their van onto my backyard, right up against the basement door practically. (Reduces 65 feet distance to maybe 15)\nI am livid. My backyard has been a mess, but I spent about 2k and 200+ hours of work this summer getting it to be absolutely beautiful. And they just fucking drove on it, obviously ripping up grass that will now need to be replanted/etc. all without asking. \nSo now I feel like, douchebag owner didn’t deliver carpet (no rush tbh) for 18 months, dodging calls throughout, asks me for address and gives me 45 minutes notice. Comes about 2 hours later. And his asshole employees ripped up grass without asking if they could drive on it. So, I know I wouldn’t tip a horrible waitress/for a horrible experience. So why should I tip these guys? \n\nOn the other hand, if I go to a restaurant, and food blows but service is okay, I would still tip. \n\nOr am I just overthinking all this lol. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for just over 6 months, so it's a fairly fresh relationship, but I love and care for him a lot, which means I also worry about him. His diet is pretty bad, mostly pizza (almost every day) and beer, maybe some meaty sandwiches, and lots of snacks like hot Cheetos and various candies, but not much in the way of veggies or nutritious meals. He often complains about not feeling good (stomach aches, lethargic, etc), but he continues to eat pretty shittily despite not feeling well and it likely being tied to his diet.\n\nLately when we're out eating I try to gently suggest getting *slightly* (baby steps) healthier options, like the other night he was getting his usual pizza and I casually suggested he get a pizza with some veggies on it, but he got his usual carnivore slice, and I could tell I just made him anxious and feel bad (his mental health also isn't too good, another thing he doesn't want to get help with).\n\n I don't want to stress him out, he's a grown man and he can eat how he pleases, I just know that it affects his health and I worry about him. AITA for suggesting he make small changes to his diet? Am I being insensitive? ",

      "description": "I work in an IT company and try to remain professional but obviously you make friends at work and usual banter and jokes are part of a work day.   \n\n\nA new girl started at the office and I helped her get on-boarded and answered all her questions. In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend went to a friend's place for a Halloween party and it was a huge party at that. Lots of people (mostly guys), a DJ, smoke machine, and all that jazz. I was turning up with my friends but she wanted to drink by herself and meet new people in the living room, which was more quieter. Anyway, to cut the story short, I look around for her but I see she isn't in the living room anymore. So I checked the bathroom, nope not there. I went to the backyard to check for her. She wasn't there either. I start to worry a bit. She did seem drunk to me and tbh, the sheer number of drunk guys made me think of the worst. I found one of our mutual friends and ask her if he saw her and he said she saw her going upstairs. It was a all-guys house so upstairs was where there rooms are. I walked into one and saw her sitting on the bed with this guy because she wanted to pet his dog. I don't know the guy personally that well but he seems like a nice person. \n\nI told her in front of him that hey I got worried about you and personally, I don't like this. The guy kinda goes up and says hey man i dont wanna be involved in this and etc. I said he's fine and that I'm not mad at him. Me and my gf come downstairs and she is angry at me for behaving badly with the guy. I really didn't know what I did except that I was worried and yes, a bit jealous. The guy comes down and she makes me say sorry to him. I was like I didn't say anything mean to him and she insisted so I apologized to him. \n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it. Nothing too crazy but I still can't shake off the feeling that I was in fact not in the wrong, even though my gf keeps insisting that I was.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry if this is long, there are a lot of moving parts here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: My husband and I bought our first house in 2010 when the market was super low. It was an older home built in 1977, 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms, needed a LOT of updating (think wallpaper everywhere, peel and stick tile, etc.), but it was super cheap and affordable for us at the time when we were young and just starting our careers. Since then we have done very well in our careers and we make significantly more money than we did when we bought it. We have also done a lot of upgrades to it and it is actually a pretty cute house and would sell quickly in our current market. In July 2017, we bought a house a little closer to work, and because it was also very affordable and within our means with our salaries, we qualified for a mortgage on our new home without having to sell the first house. (Also because the first house was so cheap.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time that we bought the new house, my parents were starting the process of building a new house. In order for them to finalize the contract for their new house, they had to sell their old one. So they sold it in October 2017 and moved into our old house, and we rented it to them for 1150/mo (650 mortgage + 500 incidentals/profit/whatever). 1150 for a 3/2 with a 1 car garage in my neighborhood and with her two dogs is an absolute steal. A house across the street that is much smaller and has less features is 1380/mo. Additionally, by delaying selling the house, we have been paying PMI for our new house, and also paying interest on credit cards that we were planning to pay off, so really, 500/mo is not exactly making us rich. In reality, my husband and I have figured out that we are probably losing money by having them there, because since they've been there the AC has gone out, the oven stopped working, sinks have leaked, etc. and the repairs have been expensive and we wouldn't have had to do them if we had sold the home in August/September 2017 as we were planning to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this year, they thought their new house would be built by now, but with problems with construction their builder has pushed it back and it doesn't look like the house will be built before March/April 2019. Now, opportunities have come up for my husband and I to move out of state for our jobs, and these opportunities would be incredible for our family, but this is where I might lose some of you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause my husband's job is requiring he start in January, but my position won't even be available until February or March, we've discussed it with my parents and my husband will move first and rent a studio apartment, and my parents will move into our new house to help me with our toddler while my husband is gone, and then we will sell the first house because it's currently got about $90k equity in it. Everyone seems to agree that this is the simplest, most straightforward solution to this very temporary problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I was talking to my mom about the logistics of it, and I asked if they would still be paying the 1150/mo while the house is on the market until it sells (because we are now going to be supporting \\*three\\* homes with utilities, rent/mortgage, etc.), and she acted like I was crazy for asking that question. \"Why would I do that? I mean, I guess I can pay the mortgage but I'm not paying the whole thing. That's ridiculous!\" so I told her (maybe kind of rudely but idk) that we would have to pay for additional utilities for the house, she and my step-dad would be taking over my master bedroom (I'll move into the guest room since there's two of them), and that my husband would be paying for utilities, rent, etc. in the new state. She did realize what I was saying and agreed to pay that, but the problem is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I had discussed offering to them a deal: if they paid us $1000/mo while they are living with me in the 2nd house, we would not sell it until their house was built in the event it takes longer than March 2019, and I would move into my husband's apartment until I can sell the 2nd house. This way, they won't have to find a place to live for a month or whatever in the event my position opens up in the new state before their house is built. I thought that was reasonable before, but now with her reaction for the first house, I'm really not sure. Would I be the asshole?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really want to cause problems with my parents but at the same time, while we are doing well financially, we definitely can't afford to support three households. And I still don't know how we will support two in two states. Also, we would be doing a heck of a lot better if we hadn't rented the house out for the last year, but I don't regret giving them a place to live in the meantime, and I know it's not their fault that the construction has taken so long.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm conflicted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read all of that... I'm impressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for Telling My Friend a Guy Tweeted About their “Relationship”?",
      "description": "To summarize this so it’s not a 3 year grad program, I have (had?) two friends, Andreas and Mel who I thought were very similar personalities so I introduced them to be friends. Not even a week later Andreas tells me he is probably in love with Mel. Mel has a much more reserved personality, to the point that I’m uncomfortable posting this but I’m not using her actual name so I should be ok. This was caused by an incident in high school that was extremely traumatic. \n\nAndreas and Mel’s “friendship” (Andreas says it was more, Mel said it wasn’t) fell apart when Andreas told Mel his true feelings a few months later and she rejected him. This began the social media parade of him moping and begging for her attention (without using her name) which we all explained to him that it’s emotionally manipulative to post that knowing she would see it. Well she did, and she cut him off. He would continue emotionally posting on social media without using her name until this month. \n\nSo this month, he started posting on twitter again about my friend (saying that they were going to hang out in person and he was going to tell her how he felt because he knew it we different this time) using her nickname so I wasn’t going to say anything, until I realized he had posted tweet after tweet detailing the times the hung out (place, time, actions, inactions, like a episode of a teen drama) and with her and my real names. Andreas’ Twitter is completely public and multiple coworkers know and follow him including myself. Mel also knows about his Twitter, but does not have an account and was not monitoring it since she had cut him off. \n\nSo after asking Mel and I’s mutual friend, I told Mel, who told me not to say anything to him because he was “in pain” and I didn’t. The next morning I wake up to an angry text from Andreas saying “Hey, it would be great that what I post on my social media you don’t go around telling people.. “ which I didn’t respond to. But then when I come into work, coworkers are telling me he’s going around telling everyone I ruined things between him and Mel because he was going to tell her how he felt in person. \n\nI’m considering if I’m an asshole for introducing them in the first place to expose Mel to this nonsense. Andreas seemed like a normal person, but his almost obsessive nature over Mel is just not ok. I know Andreas thinks I’m an asshole for telling her, but he must have known that this would be a huge deal to Mel (but he didn’t know she knew his Twitter (and exposed me to it before he even mentioned it) already). \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, for awhile now I have felt like my parents been treating my 2 youngest brother as a favorite. \nMe and him have the same personality so I really don't like him (sibling stuff, I guess), but he gets away with talking back to my parents without consequences. I told my father my opinion about step parents and when he started getting mad I said, \"okay, you're right.\" I guess I had an attitude because my father then slapped me and said how I don't get to have an opinion in his house.\nIf it were my brother my dad just wouldn't respond to him. My brother also gets away with snarky responses because he have a joking tone although he means it (if that makes sense).\nThe situation that happened recently is that, I am not doing too well in school grade wise (an F) and my brother hasn't either (2 Fs). He recently asked to go out with friends and he they sure. Parents let him go after asking who he is going with. wanting to prove that they play favorites (I told my mom about it and she said no, there is no favorites, they just want my brother to get out of the house since he usually just plays games) asked if I can go hang out with my friend(didn't really want to since they were out of town)\nThey said no I need to study. I brought up my brothers grades and my father said, \"yeah, well he doesn't ask for everything.\"\nIssue is, I buy my own stuff. I have a job. Im 17 and 2 months until im 18. The only thing I ask is to go hang out with my friends, but I do that too much according to my father.\nI do all my chores and homework and I still get shit. When my dad does let me go out, he tears in into me, \"you haven't even done your god damn chores.\" When I get home from work.\nMy brother is 15.\nMy dad had this weird thing where he yells at me then tries to kiss ass afterwards...\nToday he came in my room (day after they scolded me for asking to hang out) and said I could hang out with my friend, he just didn't want me grades to drop. This irked me more because my brother literally doesn't do his stuff but he was off the hook. Today my brother went out with his friends again.\n\nIf it changes your guys choice, I also am a female and i grew up with 3 other brothers.\n\nAITA for being pissed at my parents and considering cuttimg off my father when I move out?",

      "title": "AITA for threatening to leave my bf because he lied to me about walking another girl home?",
      "description": "So for about a year my bf (18) would walk this other girl home after school. We are in high school. Well I still am. He's a year older and graduated last year. Anyways, I found out that after school he'd take a long route home to take this other girl home first. It started when they went to the store together to purchase food for a potluck, and then my bf walked her home, and continued to do so everyday for about a year.\n\nNow, this itself is not something I am upset about as I had previously trusted him entirely. But one day I asked where he was during his walk to the other girl's home (I needed to know how much time I had to prepare for a surprise for him when he got home), he said he was by himself and taking a long detour home and that he doesn't know when he'd be back. \n\nThis is what upsets me. He lied to me. I guess he didn't know that I already knew he was walking this girl home (she happens to be my friend at this time). He also mentioned he was \" alone by himself\" which confused me at first because I had not even asked about who he was with. All I wanted to know was where he was. This is obviously a lie because I see him and the girl walk home everyday, and idk if he's just stupid for assuming I didn't know, but the fact that he lied made me very angry and upset. \n\nNot only did this lie make me mad, now I started doubting his love and faithfulness. For what reason would he have to lie to me about walking another girl home? I had come to the conclusion that he was cheating on me, but I wasn't sure if it was only emotionally or physically as well. I confronted him about this and he apologized saying he doesn't have feelings, never touched her and never did anything unfaithful. I asked him why he lied and he said \"I don't know.\" \n\nI now threaten to dump him because \"I don't know\" is probably the worst answer or excuse for something that I have ever heard. He begs me to stay and says he doesn't want to lose me, and I love this idiot so I end up staying. \n\nAfter this, however, I doubt a lot of things he says. I don't trust him anywhere near as much as I used to, and this upsets him. He thinks I'm being unreasonable and I shouldn't be so upset over something that happened in the past, and that my lack of trust is hurting him because he's trying to fix things and make up for it.\n\nSo now I wanna know other people's opinions. AITA for wanting to leave him and not trusting him after this? I have no prior experience with relationships and idk if I actually am being a dramatic and unreasonable jerk. \n\nTL;DR: My bf lied to me about walking another girl home and I threatened to leave him but I ended up staying and now he's hurt that I no longer trust him.

      "description": "   Thanks for your opinion, this is my first post to any sub in Redit.\nI clean house and do other small jobs for a lady I'll call Jill.  Jill is the type person who is very set in her ways and believes her way of doing things is not only the best way but also the most common sense way. I don't have a problem doing a job for someone the way they want it done however Jill can always find very fine, minuscule details to complain about.  The problem with this is Jill has a very sharp tongue and a harsh way of talking. She makes me feel like a slave, an idiot and incapable of doing anything right. \n   The thing is it's not really that I've done anything wrong. Maybe I did what she considered to be step 2 first or maybe I did something the way I've always done it which should be fine as long as it gets done but no, according to her I should have folded to the left instead of the right, etc. \n    I should mention I have a problem with depression and anxiety. Even on a good day for me by the time I leave her house I'm in tears, upset, defeated and just a mess. I'm a 56 year old widow, I have a very hard time dealing with the loss of my husband still. I have an adult autistic son who lives with me. I also have a daughter who is divorced and has 10 year old twin boys that I help with. I have a lot on my plate.\n    Now here's my dilemma; Jill is as I have outlined but she is also someone who believes in God and believes in being blessed by blessing others and helping people out. Jill has helped me out with some financial problems over the past two and a half years. In total she has paid off $2,100.00 in debt on my behalf which helped me out greatly. She has also done some other small things for me.  She does not want or expect me to pay her back, it was not a loan. She felt led to help me and knows that she will be blessed for doing so.\n    So, AITA for wanting to quit working for her because I feel it would help my mental and emotional health? \n    One last note, Jill has a very hard time finding people to work for her. I know this to be a fact as I've known a couple of people who have worked for her in the past but left because they would not or could not put up with being treated this way by Jill. I've come to believe now that Jill may do things for me to try and keep me there, hoping I won't quit if she does these things. \n    Thank you for reading this and for your opinions.\n",

      "description": "I’ve been in a partner group with A and U for a bit. I’m friendly with U. \nA, on the other hand, hates me. \nThe tables that we sit at are set up for only 2 people but we were the only group (to my knowledge) to have 3 so one of us had to sit at the end of the table. \nThis was uncomfortable. Also the classes are 90 minutes long. \nI would usually sit at the end of the table. But sometimes I didn’t want to, and A would ask me to and I would move. One time I didn’t want to move and U didn’t want me to move either, so A caved and let me.\nHowever this time A desperately wanted me to sit at the end of the table. I did not want to. I had gotten there before A (the class before this one was on the first floor and this was on the third floor, so if A wanted to get there before me they easily could have). U wanted to sit next to me. \nIt should be noted that while we did have assigned seats, it was not clear how we should seat 3 people at a 2-person table and the seating in this class was very fluid. People would change their seats all the time and as long as they were at the same partner groups, nobody cared.\nA walked up to me during class and demanded that I move. \nU told me not to. A started getting extremely pissed. Started yelling at me almost immediately and aggressively. \nI hated conflict against my classmates and I was always nice to everyone, including A. But I was about done. I wasn’t rude to A at all during this, by the way. \nAnyway, A yelling at me was getting a lot of attention in the relatively small and quiet classroom. My classmates were on A’s side, telling me to “just move” even though it was obviously A who was making a big deal out of it. The sub also came over and asked A what it this was all about. A told her that I was sitting in her seat and that I wasn’t a part of the group. However, most people knew that I was and the original teacher had a seating chart proving it. The sub didn’t think to look at the chart at the time. \nThe sub, who was not taking sides and didn’t really know what to do, said that we could argue this out in the principal’s office. A said okay to threaten me but I knew A was bluffing so I also said okay. But I knew if I got out A would steal my seat, so I waited for A to go first. I was kind of nervous because I’m currently relying on the fact that the principal likes me because the principal helps me out when teachers are unfair to me. Also I didn’t know if I was in the right or not. \nThe sub said we had 5 seconds to resolve this. U said I should just sit at the end of the table. Because now 2/3 of the people at the table wanted me to sit at the end, I did.\nNobody brought it up for the rest of the day.  \nThis is why I think I might have been an asshole:\n-I did technically take A’s seat even though the seating is fluid and I was there first \n-I didn’t back down even when I knew it wasn’t worth fighting over \n-Everyone thinks I was an asshole \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

So on Saturday I was going to pick her up, but she decided to go out with her friends to a party, I was flat broke and didn't feel like being social, so she told me that she would come back when she was done having drinks. Around 3AM I messaged her to see what was going on only to be ignored. I checked her snap story and seen her partying with a bunch of dudes totally drunk. I called her about 9AM to see what was going on only to be berated about how I'm such a prick for calling her so early. We made up and now New Year's eve comes and shes going out again without me because she has friends that would judge her for dating me. So she says she'll come over after new years. I didn't hear a word from her all night. I stayed in waiting for her to call for a ride, which never happened. I tried talking to her tonight and explaining why I felt upset that she ditched me completely on new years. She kept telling me that I'm the asshole for being upset. So, AITA?   ",

      "description": "Apologies if weed is a controversial topic. Throwaway account. \n\nBefore me and my fiancé met, I was an intense stoner. Like smoke weed every day kind of stoner. 100% positive that I was psychologically dependent on it. When I met my fiancé, he told me he didn’t smoke weed, haven’t since high school, didn’t like it and didn’t want it in his life. Eventually it came to the question, well do you want to stay with me even though I smoke weed? And his answer was I don’t know. I decided to try to quit and it worked out for quite a while. Soon it became this “promise” between us. Like I quit weed for our relationship.\n\nWhen I found out my mom smoked weed it sucked because it would have been cool to have smoked weed with her before I quit if I had known. She wished we had too and asked me to share a joint with her for “one and one time only” and I caved and shared one with her. Because it was my mom and I wanted the experience. Strike one. My fiancé was pissed and felt betrayed.\n\nAfter some time passed (maybe a year) it was around Christmas when a lot of people in my circle were around and visiting. There was weed around and my fiancé made the decision that he wouldn’t be mad at me if I wanted to smoke every now and then, pretty much giving his consent ever since the situation with my mom and some conversations we had over the time span. I said alright and left it at that. I did end up smoking after that, but it still caused some turmoil regardless of him saying it would be okay, so after one argument I said he should never have said that and that I would just try to stop again. He said whatever. \n\nFast forward to this year. My sister started smoking so whenever I come home, it’s here and everywhere. Intense triggers. In the beginning I was good. Could be around it and not do anything. But as time passed, the peer pressure got stronger and cravings too.\n\nNow last night, I messed up. My mom was taking a bong hit and she couldn’t clear it so she handed to me in a ‘panic’ and without thinking I cleared it. I didn’t get ‘stoned’ but I felt instantly guilty. This morning, we were talking on the phone and my fiancé asked if I got high (a recurring habit when I’m visiting family without him) and I told him what happened. He hung up on me, and texted me to tell me he doesn’t trust me anymore. I finally admitted that I think I still kind of have the psychological craving/addiction and that I fucked up. And he said whatever, I don’t care what you say or believe what you say anymore.\n\nI asked if it was okay to come home or if he wants space. His response was “Do what you want. It’s not like you care about what I want anyways” and hasn’t responded to my last text. \n\nAITA for smoking weed or is this an over the top reaction? \n\nTLDR; fiancé hates weed, so I quit, trip up and smoke, he gives me the go ahead, then gets mad when I do it, I say I’ll try to stop again, time goes by and then I smoked weed and now he no longer trusts me and doesn’t want to talk.

      "description": "I've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?",

      "description": "My parents are very religious baptists and hold a lot of traditional values.  While I am not, we're still on decent terms.  I moved out after college in the past year with my gf, which they arent thrilled about to say the least.  They also dont approve of me drinking (I never get drunk, just a beer with dinner/on a night out).\n\nWhen I lived with them, they would regularly threaten to take me off their car insurance. It happened multiple times a week, whenever I had a beer or stayed out late with my girlfriend. After years of it (and landing a good job) I moved out and got off all their insurance their policies and got my own.  They have every right to not insure me if they dont want to, so I figured I'd just be financially independent.  Note that while I am on my own insurance now, it was still a car they gave me (04 Honda Civic).\n\nLast week, I spun out on some ice.  I was driving safely but got unlucky, ended up hitting a light pole and the vehicle isnt drivable.  I am safe and have the savings to buy a replacement.  Sadly, because I'm an idiot and young, I did not have collision insurance on the car.  I will have to scrap it.  Upon hearing this, my parents are demanding the 4k they bought the car for.\n\nI really dont want to pay them for it.  In my mind, the car was a gift and they never expected repayment for it.  It was never mentioned for the three years I had the car. They even transferred the title to my name and I've been paying for all repairs and maintenance on it for years.  AITA?",

      "description": "So I have a very unconventional employment situation. I am the partner of a live-in nanny. We both moved across the country with the family she Nannys for. They asked her to move with them without me and she refused because that would have been the end of our relationship  and would have screwed me over on the lease we had just signed.\n\n The initial agreement was that we would live with then for two months then move out. But we have lived with them for 4 months now. They never discussed increasing my partners wage due to higher cost of living and refuse to. They also have hired me on at a higher hourly rate to help with maintenance around the house and filling in to watch the kids. \n\nEven though they pay me more than my partner, I only ever work ~4 hours a week (they make sure.) Well today is payday and I asked to be paid about 12 hours earlier than usual because I have a bill due before my normal pay time and wanted to make sure the money would be in my account. They are refusing to pay me until tomorrow night when I help them host a party (not something I ever agreed to do or even discussed with them) which will mean my bill is paid late and will probably incur penalties. \n\nMy partner isn't in a position to help because she gets paid half of what I do and uses most of that money to feed us. \n\nSo even though I live in my employers house for free, am I the asshole for wanting to get paid early on my own terms?",

      "description": "I have been dating my current girlfriend around 7 months now. She is someone I have known for long before we started dating and do think highly of. She tells me that she loves me and sees me as someone she would like to marry in the future. I do love her back and want the absolute best for her as well, but I cannot seem to shake what she did while we were broken up.\n\nAround the month 4 mark, we broke up for several weeks because I told her that I did not think she was putting the necessary effort into our relationship (something that was a problem from day 1 in my view). This was during a difficult and stressful time in her life (death of a close family member), and she and I struggled to communicate exactly what we were feeling and why I broke up with her as a result. While we were still broken up, she wrote me a love letter telling me exactly how she felt, why she wanted me back in her life, and what she would do to change what had happened in causing us to break up. After reading how she really felt, I told her I was ready to give our relationship a second chance, but she said that she wanted time to fully digest and understand exactly what she had written and my reasons for breaking up with her. I agreed to leave her alone and give her time. The next night, she went to a party, blacked out, and had sex with someone else who she said was a previously good friend that she has now broken contact with.\n\nWe talked the next day, and she told me what happened and that she wanted to get back together with me. I was extremely hurt by this, but I took her back as a my girlfriend a few days later because she explained her emotional hurt of me breaking up with her and alcohol at the time getting the better of her. She and I are in an \\~short\\~ LDR, and I have expressed to her multiple times how much this hurt me and how I do not fully trust her because of what happened. Recently, my trust has recovered to a degree. We hang out as often as possible, and I enjoy our time together, but I still do not see my girlfriend in the way I did before. I always have this niggling reminder of what she did, and I do not consider her as someone I would want to marry because of what happened. I have two questions: WIBTA if I stayed with my girlfriend because I enjoy her friendship, sex, other relationship things, etc..., but I no longer see her as someone I would want to marry? and... WIBTA if I broke up with her assuming I explain my full reasoning to her?",

      "description": "OK, this happened a few months ago, but my wife still brings it up as an example of how much of an asshole I am.  Personally I disagree but that's for y'all to decide.  \n\n\nIt was the middle of summer, and my Mother-in-law was in town to visit.  On an outing, the three of us went to a local aquarium/museum/botanical garden place for the day.  This was on a Sunday, and being a family fun kind of place it was pretty busy.  One of the attractions at this place is a giant glass greenhouse pyramid, with a cultivated rainforest ecosystem inside.  You can walk a trail through the forest, see tropical birds and monkeys, rare plants, and stuff. There are also some interactive educational exhibits dotted along the way.  \n\nOne of said exhibits featured a rare jungle flower, that is supposed to produce a very characteristic (foul) odor.  The sign had a button you could press to release a puff of scent.  I pressed it but didn't smell anything. seemed to be broken.  As we turned to continue down the trail, I heard the excited piping of small kids behind me.  There were 2 boys, about 7 and 9yo.  Their mother was with them (mid 30s white lady) absorbed in her phone. \n\nThe smaller one bounced up to the button and pressed it excitedly, and after a moment said \"I don't smell anything.\"  In a true moment of (what I consider genius), I told him \"Its not a very strong smell, press it again and sniff real hard\".  His nostrils flared as he smashed the button and put his face out in full sniffing position.  And I let out a surprisingly loud, squeaky fart like 10 inches from this kid's head.  \n\nThe older one spit soda all over the plant.  I thought he was going to wet himself laughing.  The younger one took a second to realize what had happened, sees my smug face, and then he too was on the floor, shirt over his nose dramatically. He was hamming it up real big.  But he too gets up laughing, pretending his face is melting off.  my gas is generally pretty mild, so he is reacting more to the concept of a fart than the actual smell.  Then I look up at the mom and see is [this face](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/1pn87G7), framed by the can-i-speak-to-a-manager haircut, blond highlights quivering with atomic rage in the humid, still air.  \n\n\"Oh. My. GOD!\" she moved toward me with her purse cocked back to swing.  \"What the hell is your problem?\" but by then it was too late. My work there was finished.  I scurried down the trail to catch up with wife and MIL.  she looked back and saw the mom shouting and my self-satisfied grin.  I told her what happened.  \"... the fuck is wrong with you?  I would have killed you, dumbass.\"  she said.  then went on a tirade about how i cant be taken anywhere in public blah blah. MIL didnt say anything, she just chuckled.    \n\nI thought it was comedy gold, the kids thought it was hilarious and now they have a story to tell.  the circumstances were too good to pass up.  I'd probably do it again given the chance.  Wife is convinced I'm a psychopath for \"assaulting\" these children.  AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to keep my son in the same school system when my SO wants to move closer to family?",
      "description": "Throwaway. I really hate putting my personal business on the internet, but I'm really conflicted here.\n\nSorry for the length - I just want to make sure I'm painting the full picture.\n\nBackground\n\nI have primary custody of my son from a previous marriage, and he must to go to school in whatever school district I live in. The separation/divorce was in 2011/2012 (he was 5) and was particularly hard on him. His mother has some significant mental health issues, and as much as I have tried, his mother and I are unable to have a stable, amicable relationship. I know this takes a toll on his well-being and although I can't force an amicable relationship with his mother, I've done my best to provide a stable home/life when he is with me. I have striven for creating a consistent routine and my son and I have a good relationship and healthy communication, but he has obviously been deeply affected by the entire process.\n\nI met my SO three years ago; she has a young son that was not school age at the time. Not shortly after we started dating, she moved closer to me (her lease was up). However, she is extremely close with her family and this move put her roughly 50 minutes away from them. It became a major issue; my SO suffers from anxiety and depression and the distance from her family was really taking a toll on her and our relationship. As her lease was nearing the end of the first year, she wanted us to move in together but also wanted to be closer to her family.  Her preference was to be within the same city as them and approximately 10 minutes away from her mother and two sisters. At the time I didn't want to move my son out of his school system. He was just starting fourth grade and because of the divorce this was the second school system that he was in. He had friends and he and I both enjoyed the school, teachers, and staff. Moreover, if we would have moved to my SO's preferred location we most likely would have had a court fight due to distance from my son's mother. Against my better judgement my SO and I compromised on a new location that was known for having a stellar school system and that kept me in a range that wouldn't cause problems with my son's mother or the court. Our compromised location put her within 20-30 minutes of her mom and sisters. We agreed that this move was supposed to be our final major move and that the goal was to plant roots in the community. We have lived in this community for a little over two years now (her son is in first grade here now and my son is in sixth), and my son has started sports here. \n\nThe Breakdown\n\nEver since we moved my SO continued to hint that she would rather have moved to her preferred location. It was never a huge fight, but it was apparent that she still wasn't happy. The time came that my SO's mother decided to move and she moved further away from us and closer to the other two sisters. We're now approximately 30 minutes away from all of my SO's family, and our relationship has struggled ever since. My SO has essentially given me an ultimatum that we need to move closer to her family again, which means a new school district for the kids. She explained that family is crucially important to her, and that she can't imagine raising a family (we were discussing having another child) this far away from them. It has gotten to the point where she says that she is willing to end the relationship if I am unwilling to move again. Her argument is that our two boys have cousins that would be in the same school system (although none of them are in the same grade) and that we could have more impromptu meetups with her family and they could \"play sports at the same parks together.\"  I understand the importance of the relationships, but my son simply does not have the same deep relationship with her sister's children as my SO's son (obviously). He was older (and had had no other brothers/sisters/cousins) when he met them and has never connected as well as we had hoped.\n\nI absolutely love my SO, but I also have a duty to my son to continue to provide stability. I don't want to rip him out of yet another school especially in middle school when kids can be so horrific. I think moving again would wreak havoc on him and his emotions. Outside of my own feelings towards moving again, I'm not even sure that the court would let me due to the increased distance to my son's mother. I could see her argument if we were hours away from her family, but I can't justify a decrease in 10 or 15 minutes of travel time at the expense of my son's well-being. I'm trying to empathize with my SO, but it's hard to feel like she is putting her own feelings in front of my son.\n\ntl;dr My SO wants to move to be 10-15 minutes closer to her family but it would involve switching my son's school for the third time. My son has already had a tough childhood.",

      "description": "I'm at the bar hanging out with my other friend minding my own business, and he sees (girlfriend) kiss another guy from across the bar. At the time, he had a girlfriend for about a year. He said, \"Yo aren't you good friends with (boyfriend)? I just saw his (girlfriend) kissing that dude from across the bar.\" He said if I saw his girlfriend doing that to another guy, he would want me to tell him. I had no clue what I was going to do. I didn't really think it was a huge deal so I went up to (girlfriend) at the bar to figure it out.\n\nNext, I go up to the girl and she continually denies it. I tell her I'm going to tell her (boyfriend), and she pins her entire friend group against me. I was honestly on the fence about bringing it up to the (boyfriend), but I received infinite FaceTime calls from her friends. I finally answer, and it's about 15 girls bitching at me, all denying the fact that she was kissing this dude. This is what pissed me off the most, so I FaceTime my buddy and tell him about the situation.\n\nEventually, (boyfriend) and (girlfriend) start talking about the whole thing, and the (boyfriend) completely takes his girlfriend's side denying that the situation even happened. At this point I'm like holy fucking shit, this girl is such a manipulative fucking bitch.\n\nFinally, the girl ADMITS the fact that she was kissing the other dude, but claims that it was not a big deal. Well, yes, I agree, maybe it would not have been a big deal had you not consistently lied to everyone around you only to admit it in the end. I'm in the middle of this whole situation, and they finally make up and they continue to date.\n\nThese girls all used to be some of my good friends, but none of them will even look in my direction at this point. Whenever I would see (boyfriend) and (girlfriend) out, it would be the most awkward thing. Basically, a situation that was not even a big deal to begin with blows up into this huge ordeal.\n\n(some background on relationship with my buddy) We were roommates freshman year in college and joined different fraternities, but still great friends. This is sophomore year now.\n\nAll of (boyfriend)'s friends take my side, saying why would he be doing this for no reason at all, explaining how I wouldn't put myself in the middle of this for no reason at all. They explained how some of my best girl friends hate me now, and they all essentially take my side. I think this is what led (boyfriend) to finally break up with her.\nEventually, (girlfriend)'s friends forget about the situation, and everything goes back to normal with them. (Girlfriend) actually wants to kill me at this point, and she still holds this against me (junior year). \n\nI feel like the biggest asshole because of this, but I just don't know if it's even my fault to begin with.

      "description": "Ok so quick preface Ive never posted to reddit before so hope this isnt an incorrect format and someone lets me know if im missing any information or incorrect lingo. \n\nMy boyfriend (25M) and I (18F) live together in my room of my parents apartment. We have been together for 7mo now and have done well together so far. \nQuick backstory, when we met he was homeless, having runaway from his parents home in another state. \nWe met at my summer and job and we hit it off quickly, but it became very obvious that I am the far more responsible one. Yet my parents could see that he genuinely made me happy and he really needed help, so they allowed him to move in with us to allow him an oppourtunity to prove himself and a man and adult. \n\nAfter a month it was agreed by both parties that he would pay 100$ a week for rent. About 400$ a month. \n\n However, He cannot keep a job, he worked his last job for exactly 7 shifts before cursing out his manager for calling him out when he No Call / No Showed. Let it be said that he does have ADHD and other issues with mental illness. But....\nHe also cannot seem to manage his own money. This is where my current issue comes into play. \n\nWe live in a Recrecational Marijuana state, and while it is legal for anyone above 21+ to consume it, he uses it to a point of dependency; in conjunction with playing my old PS3 for a minimum of approx. 6 or more hours a day. \n\nMy issues here: he got 50$, half of his owed weekly rent, two days ago and spent it on a new game and several grams of dabs. \n\nSince he lost that last job (a month ago) he hasnt left the house but maybe twice, and now he is now 100$ (One Hundreded Dollars) behind in his rent and feels that somehow it is too much of me and my family to ask him to do that and that he should be able to pay less money for washing dishes, buying groceries with foodstamps and generally light cleaning. \n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting my grown man, adult partner to pay 100$ a week for rent ?",

      "description": "I'm 'in the closet' as being an ace publically, for context. I've only ever admitted it online to randoms, and only came to the conclusion about 9 months to a year ago. I'm not the biggest 'people person' to begin with and a less than fun childhood means I'm very particular about my personal space.\n\nSo this starts about a year and a half to two years ago, housemates conviced me to install tinder, we lived in a university town so I figured I'd just upload some decent pics, write something pithy and be away with it. And after 6 months or so of not getting anywhere, barely getting any matches and when I did try making conversation it was more of an uphill struggle than I thought it was worth, so I promptly uninstalled the app when I had to move at the end of the university year and forgot about it.\n\nFast forward 6 months or so, with some therapy and counselling sprinkled in, I'm back at my home town spending a lot of time in my room depressed due to moving back to a small shithole in the middle of nowhere, when i noticed I never actually uninstalled tinder, I just moved it off my home screen, so I boot it up and flick through just to see what was out there now I was back home, having a laugh with my mate about spotting people we knew back from school etc.\n\nHe's pretty much the polar opposite of me, out every weekend, over 100 matches, etc so he looks over my profile, changes a few things and tells me to take some better pictures, so we do. I went from bad angles, poorly fitting clothes and a rough beard to me looking smart in my work uniform and a few casual shots of me sat in a pub garden in summer, work my way through my swipes again and going to bed, only when i woke up I had two (2!) whole new matches, more than I got in a month in the university town. I was too shocked at actually getting a match to say anything to them, so I just left them.\n\nThen I just sort of carried on, playing about with the settings to get the best coverage, turned it almost into a game with me telling my mate every time I 'got one', and we even joked about setting up drinking game rules after reading the same copy/paste biographies time after time. \n\nThe question I have is, am I the asshole for matching with these girls and then never opening a line of communication with them? For a while after the initial rush of actually getting attention I'd only swipe left, but my mate told me that swiping too much one way or the other causes the algorithm to think your account is a bot and limits what you're able to see and do, so I turned back to an average/random swiping pattern which means i still get a match once in a blue moon.\n\n\nBut obviously being the person doing the deed means I can't judge myself from an outside perspective, which is where you lovely people come in.\n\nTLDR: Use tinder for an ego boost and people spotting despite having no intentions of commiting to anything. Should I stop?",

      "description": "Back story: my aunt and I had a falling out a few years ago because her teenage daughter would come to me about boy issues (I was 26 at the time and what teenage wants to talk to their mom about sex?). She completely cut me off, my uncle was forced to stop talking to me, and her 4 kids were told to stop talking to me and no longer allowed to communicate with me in any way. She has since apologized but the relationship has not been the same, it's very fake, and her husband wont even acknowledge I exist.\n\nFast forward: my husband and I are a blended family. We have 3 kids total, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage and he has 1 from a previous relationship. We bought a house right after getting engaged and have done a lot to upgrade the house and he has spent a lot of money in lawyer fees to get more custody of his daughter. I was in nursing school, just recently graduated in May, and didnt have a job until this September. Such a good man to take on a woman in school with 2 children while having one of his own. But needless to say, the money wasn't coming in. \n\nWhen we had announced our engagement, my mother wasn't the ecstatic mother asking to go dress shopping and venue shopping. In fact, the entire year we were engaged there was zero interest or talk of the wedding... from anyone in the family. So my husband and I decided to plan something small that only incorporated us and our 3 kids, with our close family and our 2 best friends in attendance. We had no bridal party, no big venue, and no DJ and dancing. We were paying for the entire thing ourselves, without any help from our families. It was a Sunday afternoon in a nice restaurant near our house. Including the 5 of us, there were a total of 20 people at our wedding. It was beautiful and turned out to be the perfect day and the perfect way for us to complete our family unity. \n\nBut back to the reason I am writing, I deliberately made the decision to make my wedding day about what my husband and I wanted. It was small, and as said before coming out of our pockets, and I chose not to invite my mom's one sister (I invited the other 3 siblings) that causes a lot of tension and hostility. Her husband can't even look my way when I come into a family party let alone say hi, and has never once acknowledged my husband. I made the conscious decision to forego my Grandmother's, mother's, and all of my aunt's feelings and make our day about me and my husband. Does this make me an asshole?\n\nI wouldn't be writing this if it weren't for the upheaval that decision I made caused. My mother told me I was dividing the family. She begged me to invite my aunt saying she would pay for her meal. My other aunt's who already replied yes backed out. My Grandmother &amp; aunt told me my Grandfather was looking down from Heaven with tears in his eyes. (SIDE Story: My Grandfather and I were very close and out all of his daughters, Grandchildren, wife, and great-grandchikdren; I was the only person to stand up and speak at his funeral. They used him against me because they knew it would cut deeply.)  It has been months since our wedding and I am still treated like Satan himself due to that one decision. My husband and I have been fully enjoying our married life and have a great time with our kids. If given a chance to make this decision again, I wouldn't change a thing. My husband stands beside me and has throughout this entire thing. Neither of us truly care what my family thinks of our decision, we just want to know from an outsider's perspective if we truly are the assholes.\n",

      "description": "So to make sense of the title, let me give some brief background. My boyfriend (26m) and I (24f) have been together for close to 4 years. Early on we both expressed a desire to try opening up our relationship at some point, but we decided not to rush things to give ourselves more time to grow in the relationship and continue to develop our trust in one another.\n\nRecently, we finally decided that we were both ready to try opening things up. We sat down together, had a long discussion and laid out some ground rules. We agreed that our relationship would be open for 2 weekends (so 4 days total). We agreed that there would be no continued contact with partners after sleeping with them outside of the designated days, and no flirting/setting up hookups outside of those 4 days. Too keep things less complicated, we agreed not to fuck anyone we knew. Condoms were mandatory, and we agreed to let each other know where we were going and who we were with (mainly for safety). We also agreed that the arrangement was over after the second weekend, and we would then evaluate it and decide how we proceed with things.\n\nWe were both excited, and we went out clubbing on the first Saturday looking to pick up. I ended up going home with a guy that night for sex, but my boyfriend went home alone. He downloaded Tinder on Sunday but didn't really spend much time with it, since he was happy just to wait until the next weekend. \n\nNext Saturday came and we went clubbing again. I hooked up with a different guy that night and again in the morning. My boyfriend went home alone again. He spent almost his entire Sunday on Tinder, but couldn't arrange a hookup in time. He had one girl who seemed interested in him but it didn't work out in time. I felt really bad for him but just encouraged him that he will do better next time.\n\nHe was pretty down following our arrangement, and he admitted that he couldn't help but feel jealous that I had slept with 2 guys and he had slept with nobody. I told him that next time I would help him, but he said he didn't think he wanted to do another. He said that he just wanted to sleep with someone to even things up. He wanted to continue talking to the girl from tinder and meet up with her.\n\nI pretty much flat out said no. I did not feel comfortable with him flirting with a girl on Tinder after it was over, especially since it went against all our agreed upon rules. I would be fine with it if we sat down and planned another agreed arrangement, but his ego is too fractured for that and he just wants to see where things go with this Tinder girl. I do not feel comfortable with this after we agreed to stop, and I don't like the idea of doing it just to be even. I would be open to letting him sleep with another girl in the future, but I would need to have a serious discussion and ground rules like the last time.\n\nAm I an asshole for not being ok with this?",

      "description": "I live in a Christian family that isn’t huge on religion. However, every once and a while my sister will get super religious for some reason and will either blast or sing random gospel and Jesus songs. I have literally memorized certain ones because they are **all I hear.** She won’t use earbuds or headphones. She’ll just set her phone to full volume and sing along. When she doesn’t have her phone she’ll wait her hum the song or full blown opera house sing it. \n\nThese bouts usually happen after she goes to a camp or retreat that involves Christianity. This Friday she left for an ACTS retreat. When she got back today, it was particularly worse. She was doing to usual, walking around, singing, “basking in the glory of god,” as she would call it.\n\nAfter months of enduring this, I finally snapped.\n\n“Hey, could you use earbuds or turn it down please?”\n\nShe looks at me like she’s dumbstruck. Of course, having no ability to win an argument, she decides to take the moral high ground, questioning me on whether I love god and accept him. When I say yes, she asks me why I want her to turn down her beautiful music. I reply that it’s not that I don’t like it, it’s just that it’s really loud. Goody two shoes of course replies that I should not complain and that I should be listening to it too.\n\nI have nothing against this kind of music when it’s played *in an appropriate setting.* Am I the Asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Context: My (34f) mom and dad have been divorced for 25 years. My mom remarried fairly quickly. My dad also remarried but after his second wife died unexpectedly, he spent the last ten years of his life depressed, suicidal, suffering from substance issues and homeless.  He died unexpectedly from sepsis after an unknown illness that he did not seek treatment for.  \n\nWhen my parents divorced my dad was ordered to pay child support. He was also ordered to maintain a small life insurance policy that would provide support to his two children (my sister and I) in the case of his death.  Obviously the primary beneficiary was my mom since she was our custodial parent. \n\nWhen my sister and I both turned 18, he let the policy lapse as he was no longer required by the court order to maintain it. \n\nFast forward to present day: my dad dies and my mom pulls up this insurance policy that although lapsed will still payout $10k or so in the event of his death. So she files a claim. It's approved. She gets a check.\n\nI assumed since the purpose of the policy was for the benefit of my dad's children, that my sister and I would split the payout. We wanted to use the majority of it to pay for travel to Alabama to clean out his apartment and to pay for his funeral. We would have used whatever was left over to pay down some student loan debt that my mom co-signed on (she co-signed some debt because my dad didn't want to help pay for college). I thought paying down the debt was a great way to benefit both her and us. It was a way for my dad to posthumously help with paying for college.\n\nInstead, my mom says she has bills that need to be paid. She is ultimately entitled to the money. She will pay us back for the funeral (it really just amounted to cremation expenses) but that's it.  \n\nMy sister and I were extremely upset. my dad would roll over in his grave if he knew. I'm sure that if he knew while he was alive that there could still be payout that he would have changed the beneficiaries to us. \n\nBut we dropped it. Didnt argue with her or make it an issue. Just dutifully took care of his affairs and that was that.\n\nIf you made it this far.....AITA for expecting my mom to give the money to my sister and I?\n\n",

      "description": "So this happened at Spiderman: Homecoming on opening night back in 2017. \n\nMe my friend and his sister got really good seats pre booked and so we were all set. A quarter the way into the movie I notice this child in the family behind us is constantly talking every time something happens. The Vulture and his construction crew get screwed over by shield, the Vulture first attacks spiderman, etc. All I hear is \"who is that\", why is that happening\". Even at one of the most important parts of the movie towards the final fight \"what did that mean?\". \n\nI get this is a Spiderman movie.... for kids, but Jesus Christ. Multiple times I look back and quietly say \"hey man your kid is being loud\" and get \"yeah sorry\" in response. Nothing is done over the 2 hours. So by the end I was pretty pissed off ngl. Regrettably it lead to me saying something and it played out like this:\n\n\n\nKid's mom: \"wow that was a really great movie!\"\n\nMe: (outloud without facing them) \"Yeah it was, except for the child behind me that never stopped talking\" \n\nKid's dad: \"excuse me!?\"\n\nMe: (now standing facing them) \"I asked you multiple times to do something and you never did. We all paid 20$ each to be here and you almost ruined the experience.\"\n\nKid's dad: \"You shouldn't confront someone like this in front of their kids! Why didn't you ask me privately instead of this?\" \n\nMe: \"I dont blame the kid, but maybe you should learn that if you annoying stangers in public, they aren't going to react very well.\"\n\n(At this point there are onlookers and my friend/his sister are looking worried) \n\nKids dad: \"You know what I got something to say to you\" \n\nMe: \"yeah? Go right ahead bud\"\n\nHe looks at his family and the people around him and just let's out this sort of angry sigh. We both walk away but my friend stayed back to do his own apology to them. \n\nI feel it wasn't the best way to handle it, but fuck do I hate it when parents are so up there own ass like that! I didn't swear, I didn't yell, and I waited till the end of the movie to say something. Yet I didn't come out of it feeling any better. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: kid wouldn't stop talking, I confronted the dad in front of exiting theatre. Could of escalated and gone badly, but didn't. \n\n\n",

For a few months, our group has all assumed that they were dating but now that we've gotten to know her, she's come to a few of us and asked her what to do about a few guys who have asked her out to formal when she didn't want to go with any of them (including Paul), which we helped her deal with. Paul was pretty upset, as he thought they were dating but Bella didn't, she thought they were just friends the whole time.\n\nThe AITA part is that after we helped her deal with it, she asked me out and I said yes since I've liked her the whole time, but just kept it under wraps. I feel like Paul feels pretty betrayed by both of us, but the whole time I thought they were dating I never showed anything and didn't try to sabotage them at all, if anything the opposite. I told Paul about what Bella said to me the day after and to my face he said it's ok, but he has been very downhearted since, and has mentioned that it's really painful seeing us together to other friends.

      "description": "Our kids are good kids but don’t do enough around the house, particularly on housework day. Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn’t feel very motivated because I’m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I’m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she’d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she’d get me to cut the wifi if he didn’t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn’t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can’t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can’t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can’t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn’t exchanged words. He’d already planned to stay at a friend’s so he’s probably getting plastered. It’s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because “he’s not in a good state of mind.” I can’t help worrying too. He’s not answering her texts.\n\nI’m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he’s an adult. I don’t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. ",

      "description": "My (F24) boyfriend (M24) has been talking about going into the military since we met over a year ago. I asked him multiple times why this was his career choice in the first place, and the only reply I’ve gotten more frequently is that it was his only option (i.e. college isn’t for me, I don’t have other skills, can’t make a living doing min wage jobs, etc). He also has expressed interest in being in the military for travel reasons and benefits, but the other reasons still stand. I have a full time job as a nurse, so money is not much of an issue for me. He wants to make more, naturally, so that he and I will be set in the future. \n\nHe and I have talked about the future and it is apparent that whatever avenue life takes us, we will be together.  But, I have brought up the fact that going into the military is a giant time commitment and will have him be away during the best years of our young lives. I have brought up so many other routes as well (especially fire) and he brushes over them. He is pretty dead set on going to the military although multiple people in his friend group, family, and mine, have advised him against it. \n\nTonight, he and I went to my mothers house for dinner and she mentioned that our local fire dept was hiring for entry level into the academy. I immediately backed her up and explained what a wonderful idea what this was. We kept explaining each reason why it would be better for him, and us, if he chose this route. I at least ask him to consider it as an option and he glazes over it with barely any acknowledgement. \n\n I guess my question is that I am wondering if AITA for cornering him with my mother in beliefs that multiple people hold, including myself, about this? Is he TA for not even considering it? ",

I guess he's a bit tired of babysitting Jenny. I consider offering to watch her, but he's turned me down in the past in similar situations in which he could have used help with her but refused anyway because pride or whatever. So I don't bother offering and he doesn't ask me to help either. I go to my room.\n\nThen Mom comes home and goes crazy. Apparently I was supposed to watch Jenny today, even though no one ever asked me to. According to mom, I should have helped Ben in the very least. I would have, if he asked, but he didn't! She then calls me ungrateful little shit, because Ben always helps me with things and I didn't help him today. \n\nAlso, Ben didn't even go talk to me about me not helping him afterwards and I don't think he actually complained about me to mom. She just saw him annoyedly watching Jenny upon arrival and started shouting at me. Ben just disappeared into his workroom. So I have no idea what he thinks about all this.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I am always told by family that I am just being \"fussy\" when I ask my roommate to pay his share of the rent on time and in full. He always pays it late, and often late by several days, if not several weeks. The lease and the bills are in MY name, so this looks bad on ME when it is late. I am also poor, so I cannot just cover his side of the rent. \n\nThe roommate is my cousin, and my previous roommate was another cousin, both from the same family. They both had issues paying their bills, even when they HAD the money! Both of them have issues with spending, and will often spend hundreds of dollars a month on junkfood and crap instead of paying their actual bills. I feel as if they think that because the bill is in my name, that they don't have to care about paying it on time, and that makes me feel highly disrespected in my own home.\n\nWe are helping out the current roommate due to financial issues, which is the only reason we let him stay. Despite this, he never lets us know when he will be able to pay the rent and his one utility. He simply does not pay. When I ask about it, I am always hit with \"I'll have it tonight\" or \"I'll have it tomorrow\" or on the weekend, and it never comes. Sometimes I am able to pay his side of the rent 1-5 days after it is due, other times it can be up to 21 days after the grace period. \n\nI feel bad, as the landlords like me, but I feel like the landlord's good will is going to run low. I am always on the hook when these bills are late, and over the past few years, I have had to shill out over 2000 USD of my own money, which would have otherwise gone towards taxes and food, to pay for bills that that they simply do not pay. I make less than 8000 USD a YEAR, and most of it goes towards rent, food, and medical expenses. I often have to live on a tight budget, and can never buy anything for myself. \n\nI feel like I am being taken advantage of, but I am unable to say anything. When I try to bring it up, I get shut down. I am told that they \"work hard\" or that \"they're family\" and I am just expected to deal with all this nonsense. \n\nI am on the verge of breaking down and my lack of funds makes me so stressed that I cry about how I am going to make ends meet. But they do not seem to care. \n\nMy cousins are over 20 years old, with full-time jobs, and I constantly have to nag at them to even get the money. If I did not nag them for the money, they probably would not pay at all. And they don't even clean any part of the house either, so it is often a mess. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting my roommates to pay their share?",

I found it somewhat amusing that a competent and grown person had this kind of voice. while I would never say anything about this to A, I did however mention this to colleague B who works in the same department as A. I meant it as a gag of the usual kind and nothing more.\n\nturns out B told A about this, and A, understandably, got upset. I would be too, if I heard shit like that from someone I've just spoken with on the phone. I know B spilled the beans because today I got a physical letter to my desk from A, and the letter goes like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*dear \\[OP\\],*\n\n*you've acted inappropriately towards me.

I hate you.*\n\n*sincerely,*\n\n*A*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis letter made me feel like a piece of shit since I never intended that A should know about my infantile joke about A's voice.

      "description": "My wife and I selected the very back row in the plane since we were flying with our 1yr old son and would need to change him. During the booking process nothing indicated this was a problem.\n\nWhen we were checking our bags they informed us they couldn't legally sit a baby in the back, so they'd moved us to like row 7 in the front (premier). An upgrade! Woo!\n\nMid-flight my son needed to be changed badly and I looked back towards the rear lavatory and there was the food cart in the way serving people. As such I headed up past first class to the other lavatory.\n\nAs I walked that way the stewardess told me to use the rear lavatory to which I said 'I can't, there's a cart serving people and he needs to be changed now unless you want poop everywhere'.\n\nShe sort of sighs and says ok fine. I go in and begin the process of changing my son in this tiny ass bathroom with barely enough room for myself to squat. No more than 2 minutes into the process she knocks on the door and goes 'Are you done yet'? (Rude as hell, now I'm annoyed).\n\nNot 30 seconds later she gets on the intercom that ONLY announces to the speaker inside the lavatory. At about plane-engine volume I hear 'Please get out of the lavatory immediately a first class passenger needs to use it'.\n\nNow I'm pretty much furious. I finished changing my son as quickly as I could while she continued to talk through the door like I'm some sort of degenerate for making this person wait not even 5 minutes while I change my infant son.\n\nI was PISSED. Got everything done and as I walk out I see this bro-lookin dude talking to the stewardess about how he was first class and it was insulting that someone not in first class could use the lavatory up there.\n\nWe TRIED to be polite and sit near the rear lavatory and they bumped us to the front. Not my damn fault they put us in this situation.",

      "description": "I’ve been posting on here a lot recently, but I’ve been going through a lot with my friend group. For this story, I will use A, B, and C to describe my three best friends. \nFriends A and B both very much dislike C. C tries her best to be kind to them even though they basically hate her. I have told A and B many times that I’m still going to be friends with C and that I would not, and never would, force them to be friends with C. B accepted this, and I hang out with her separately from C and all is well. Friend A however, does not accept this. She frequently makes comments that are either passive aggressive or clearly against my friendship with C. If she asks what I’m doing over the weekend and if I come over and I tell her I’m busy she normally says “you’re probably going to hang out with C” In a rude tone. Other times if I say “wanna sit next to me in math” she’ll say “I thought you’d want to sit next to C” and other times she’ll make up lies about things C did to her. I found out a few days ago that A and B were trying to make a plan to get me to stop being friends with C. It was mostly controlled by A, but B was involved. I’ve been arguing with A a lot recently, about many things. (I made a post about it previously.) I talked to A and B about their plan. B said she was fine with me being friends with C as long as they didn’t have to hang out. I agreed with her. A still did not agree. I’ve been doing my best to hang out with A and B separate from C, but we are all in the same classes, sit at the same table during lunch, and ride the same bus. I’m not really sure if I’m being an ah to friend A because I’m still close friends with C. What do you all think? ",

Of course, if someone hunts for fun or races greyhounds, I probably *really* hate them and don’t want to be their friend, but I separate overt abuse from omnivorism because I see omnivorism as a sort of result of social programming and cognitive dissonance rather than total disregard or hatred for the rights of animals, as evidenced by the fact that omnivores often get upset when hearing about dog-eaters, SeaWorld, etc.\n\nBut when it comes to a boyfriend, I wouldn’t date somebody who eats animals. It’s such an important value to me that I simply wouldn’t seriously date somebody who doesn’t hold that same value.\n\nI mentioned this to some friends and they seemed appalled, saying that I’m being discriminatory and “fascist”.

Also, my apologies for the length of this post.\n\n     Ok so I am in my 4th but not final year of college  (took a year “off”) and absolutely adore one of my best friends since freshman year, we’ll call him Dan. Dan and I have been tight for four years and although I’ve always had a secret crush on him, I’ve always dismissed any signs that he was interested in me. We were both in other relationships for a while and during that span of time, I viewed Dan as just a friend and all my former romantic feelings for him disappeared. \n\nNow that we are both single those feelings of attraction have crept up again and I have reason to believe he is attracted to me but there is a problem. \n\n     Sarah, one of my absolute best friends on this earth has been part of our very tight mutual friend group since our sophomore year. She has a massive crush on Dan and everyone in our group (including Dan) knows it. At this point I think that Dan is interested in both of us but I have always deferred to Sarah as I know she is way more invested than I am.  I haven’t really responded to any flirting Dan has done with me because I don’t want Sarah to feel like I have betrayed her. \n\nBut here’s the thing Sarah won’t be around next School Year as she is taking a year abroad. WIBTA for making a move on Dan while she is gone? I more or less plan on at least testing the waters with him but does that make me a snake(asshole)?  ",

She likes it, but I don’t think cares nearly enough as me about it.  I say that because she will also be on her phone during the show.  With this show you have to pay really close attention or you will miss a lot and that’s where the problem comes into play.  \n\nShe keeps talking throughout it during.  It’s driving me insane.   “Who’s that?”  “What are they doing?”  “Why did he do that?”   All of her questions would be answered if she paid attention to the show, but she’s only half in half out.   That’s fine, but don’t ruin it for me.   I’ve tried pausing while I answer her questions, but the show is so complicated that usually she just acts bored when I start up.  \n\n\nI like that we have this show that we both enjoy and can watch together.   Usually it’s not the case and we have to fight for the remote haha.  She gets mad when I watch without her, but I have to go back rewatch episodes sometimes because her constant talking throughout makes me miss a lot of details.  \n\nIt’s never good to lie, but I feel like in this case it might be better than telling her she needs to be quiet while we watch.   I’d rather just binge the rest of the series while she’s gone and pretend that it’s a first time viewing when I watch with her. ",

It's easy.\n\nSo I get a call at 1:30 in the morning. I'm laying in bed awake talking with my wife. I know who it is and we both look at each other about the call. She tells me to ignore it. I felt horrible but I just let it ring. \n\nA little extra info. My co-worker is a cancer survivor who is struggling with fighting her battle. I have covered for her countless times and will always help her out when I can. She's a great lady. She might have needed my help or something, or (more likely) just needed a cover for the next day. \n\nBut it was almost 2 in the morning, and the shift I know she was going to be asking me to cover would be at 6 am. I live an hour away from work, so that means that if I were to take this shift, I would literally get less than 3 hours of sleep to then do a 12 hour shift. And my next scheduled shift is the day after, a night shift, from 6pm to 6 am the next day. Which is why I was awake that late to begin with. \n\nNow mind you I have voicemail but she doesn't leave a message. 10 minutes later she calls again! But again leaves no message. UGH! \n\nAITA for choosing my own sleep schedule over answering this call? I know if I answered I would say yes no matter what. ",

      "description": "I (20F) babysit my 5 year old autistic sister for my parents. My mom is pregnant and is due to give birth to another baby girl in the beginning of May, who I will also babysit once she is done with maternity leave. \n\nI pick my sister up from school at 3pm 4/5 days out of the week, and watch her until around 8pm. When I begin babysitting the baby, I will have her from 1pm until 8pm alongside the 5yo.\n\nToday, a family friend (who is a CNA, and works 7a-7p+hour drive to and from work) posted on Facebook about needing a babysitter for her almost 3 month old son. The father works 3rd shift in a factory, so he sleeps all day before going back to work at night. \n\nMy mother commented and said that I would do it without even asking me, and only told me afterwards to warn me that the FF would be messaging me about it. At first I was a little annoyed, but then my grandmother (who is much closer with this family) called me to inform me about the hours she works, and also that they’re really struggling for money so they’re probably going to pay me nickels and dimes—if they even pay me at all. \n\nI was slightly more annoyed. \n\nThen FF messaged me and we talked about it. I’d be watching her son from 6am-8pm 4 days in a row out of every week. The most she could offer to pay me was $10 a day, and even that would really tighten their budget. That’s roughly 71 cents an hour. 14 hours of babysitting a day, 4 days in a row out of every week—for $40 a week? Yeah... no. \n\nI feel bad telling her no, but the idea of juggling a newborn, a less-than-one-yo, and a 5 year old autistic child terrifies me. Plus, how am I ever going to fit 3 car seats in my vehicle? I drive a truck. Two infant seats and a booster seat in one  back bench is not feasible, or safe.\n\nI confronted my mom about her offering up my services without my consent. We got into a fight. She says I’m cruel for not helping out a struggling family, and I should’ve been willing to do it for free. FF is upset, so is her husband. \n\nAITA for confronting my mom for offering me up for jobs without even asking me, and refusing to do the work she offered me up for?\n\nTL;DR: I babysit for my parents, just a 5yo at the moment—soon to be a newborn as well. Mom offered me up to babysit a friend’s 2/3mo without asking. They want to pay me $40 for 56 hours of babysitting per week. ",

She has always been in our lives here and there but nothing like this. I should note they didn’t go out for long. Anyways recently he is constantly hiding his phone and I finally got sick of it and did some snooping, which I know isn’t the best idea HOWEVER I was going crazy! We were recently visiting family in my hometown, where she lives as well. My husband decided to make an appointment at the doctors and I was just hanging out with my family at home. Anyways fast forward to the snooping in the messages he said he wanted to meet up with her and he planned his appointment around her lunch break. He never actually ended up seeing her because his appointment changed but it was the fact that he was planning on being sneaky behind my back.  I wouldn’t have cared if he told me but finding out like this is frustrating. The messages between them seemed intimate, nothing like flirting or anything. Just really deep conversations. Anyways my husband says I shouldn’t have been snooping, but I said he should have told me about this. I don’t like that he talks to her and is it fair for me as his wife to find this relationship inappropriate. AITA?",

So me being the kind person i am i just stop messaging him. Fast forward 2 days a female classmate of mine tells me she plays PUBG (i'm kind of known in the class for being sort of good at the game) and tells me her IGN. So FF and I  just play and play and play. 1 game she actually clutched a very nerve racking game (her vs 2 squads) and she just was so proud. She posts it to her WhatsApp status and hey my MF tells me: \"You fucking twat you never invite me to play anything nowadays\" \"Go fuck yourself you inconsiderate fuckshit\"  \"Bring that FF over and fuck her how about that\".\n\nHe then proceeds to block me on WhatsApp.",

      "description": "Apologies for the length of this. Disclaimer, this does involve cannabis. \n\nThis story is an issue that arose between me and my flatmate \n\nI recently travelled to Amsterdam for a holiday with a friend.\n\nWhile there, my flatmate asked me to buy some hash, pop it into the post and send it back to him. He stated in text that he would send me the money for it. He had done the same thing by sending hash to Greece and was pretty confident that it would work.\n\nMe and my friend agreed that this would be a good idea and would do this for ourselves as well.\n\nThe final day in Amsterdam we bought the hash and the required stamps and went about sending these back. \n\nMe and my friend considered what would be the best way to do this. Either send it in 1 package and risk losing it all (£100) or send it in separate packages and increase our chances of getting at least one thing back through. We decided to send it in 3 packages, 2 to my house, 1 to my friends. All aware that every package could get caught and all our money would be up in smoke (pun intended) \n\nWe travelled back without issue and waited for the packages to arrive.\n\nThe first package arrived at my house. My flatmate was awake when it arrived, opened it (to see what it was as we didn't write names in it) and left it outside my room and told me I could have the first one as I sent it.\n\nThe second package arrived at my friend's house 2 days later. So we expected the third package shortly.\n\nUnfortunately the third package still hadn't arrived weeks after\n\nI said to my flatmate that I had made a mistake on the address on one of the packages, Realised my mistake, scored it out and rewrote the address, which could be the reason that it was taking slightly longer. He accepted this and we kept waiting.\n\nI received my bank statement at the end of the month and realised that he hadn't sent me the money for this... Transaction? . Meaning that I was out money for this.\n\nI brought this up, asking me if he could send me the money for this.\n\nThis is where the argument started.\n\nHe said that he wasn't going to give me the money for it for the following reasons -\n\nHe shouldn't have to pay because his was the one that hadn't shown up.\nHe couldn't understand why we had sent it in 3 packages and it was my fault that one hadn't got through.\nI had made the mistake on the package and as such it was my fault it hadn't arrived.\nHe also stated that there was no proof there even was a package in the first place, implying I was lying to him and attempting to hustle him.\nIt was unfair that one had arrived to our house and it was mine rather than split\n\nI appreciated that it was unfair and really I should have kept a closer eye on my finances because if I had asked him before any of them showed up then I would have been asking him to pay for the risk, rather than once it seemed that it wasn't showing up, where he was paying for nothing. However I did think it was unfair that this was his suggestion and I was down money because it hadn't gone his way and I felt he was just throwing excuses at me to justify not paying for it even though we were all aware we were paying for the possibility rather than the item. \n\nThe argument was for nothing as the day after we had shouted at each other, the package arrived.\n\nHowever I still want to ask, was I the asshole here?

      "description": "**warning...warning...** THIS IS NOT A VALIDATION POST. I KNOW WHO I AM. I do not need validation from strangers. I want to know if I SHOULD have done something different and as such IF I should do something different the next time this type of thing comes up. \n\n**preface:**\n\nSome background is in order. I am one of four sisters. I am the second oldest. I have always been a bit a black sheep in that my genetics take after my mom's side of the family and I am much heavier than my sisters who are all spectacularly gorgeous, thin and athletic. I am \"pretty\" but I also weight 250lbs (which I was ashamed of for a long time, now I try to accept who I am which is why I don't mind saying it here). \n\nEarlier in the year my dad mad a huge amount of money from selling some stock options at his work. His dream has always been taking a huge family vacation so my parents, myself, two of my sisters and their spouses and kids (all under 10) with my other single sister rounding it out are all on the trip. We were at an absolutely gorgeous beach resort for Christmas. \n\nI decided since I've accepted my weight as it is, I was also going to not be ashamed and \"cover up\" like I used to. In fact, I figured \"screw it, I'm 28 and was going to catch me a hot foreign dude on the trip. I'm showing some skin!\" So I got three new swimsuits, one is a full on thong one piece, the other two are very \"cheeky\" bikinis. \n\n**the incident:**\n\nMaybe four days in I finally felt confident enough to wear the one piece without a sarong. when I got down to the beach with the rest of the family I took off my robe and laid down, first on my back. I could see my older sister just staring daggers at me and when I turned over to get some sun on my bum, she said something like \"seriously Janey? There's kids here!\" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that it was totally inappropriate that my ass was \"hanging out.\" I told her I didn't appreciate her comment. She said she didn't appreciate me embarrassing her. I told her to take a look at our youngest sister (who is 19) and she was literally wearing a string bikini with mere inches of fabric that showed more of her ass than mine. \n\nMy oldest sister then told me that if I didn't understand the difference than there was something wrong with me. I asked her if it was because I was fat? She told me something really rude like \"Janey this is why we don't have a relationship, you make everything fucking difficult.\" She then packed up her husband and kids and left the beach and I didn't see them until dinner that night. \n\n**The fallout:** \n\nMy oldest sister didn't say a friendly word to me the entire rest of the trip. She has some wicked mean girl abilities and because of her I was pretty much isolated from my family from the rest of the trip. I did get to go to a few dinners but no one would tell me when they were going to the beach so for the rest of the trip I didn't see get to see or play with my nieces and nephews on the beach. It sucked and made me feel really sad, neglected and even guilty for standing my ground. \n\nWe all independently flew home and I have gotten emails from my oldest sister, my mom and my dad all saying that \"your clothing choices essentially ruined a family vacation and we are so disappointed.\" Just on a lark I called my youngest sister and said something like \"hey sis, crazy how our family is freaking out about thong swimwear, even though its the style everywhere now...huh!?\" she responded with \"what are you talking about? no one is freaking out about my swimwear.\"  So yeah...they are again freaking out because I'm a bigger girl. Skinny girls can show their ass, fat girls can't. \n\nWell to top all of this off, I just found out that my two sisters with kids are planning on meeting up in Destin for Spring Break because their kids had so much fun on the beach with each other. The trip has been mentioned to my younger sister, I don't think she's technically invited but I'm sure they wouldn't say no if she wanted to go. Guess who hasn't had the trip mentioned to them...even though I spoke with my other middle sister. Yup. \n\nSo did I cause all these by being the asshole by wearing the swimsuit of my choice? Or is this my family being shitty to me?\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "I’ve got a compulsion to offer my opinions/predictions whenever I feel the need (often)- to anyone and everyone, whether my opinion is asked for or not (almost never). Its not always negative and I'm just as liberal with honest praising, I reckon, but naturally, the critical comments are what people remember. \n\nI don't think I'm smarter than anyone else and im conscious enough of my own loose morals to prevent me delivering anything too preachy - it's more about probability as I see it and a genuine caring and want for people to be better and happier than they are. My intention is just to give them the extra info and then it's up to them. I'm invariably ignored anyway, but frustratingly, my crystal ball is often on point.\n \nFor example, about a year ago I called my brother-in-law and strongly insisted he stop driving around in the middle of every other night, when he's on a 5+years suspended license for a previous drink+drug driving charge and in a car with obvious visible defects. No-one close to him had the nerve to tell him how dumb that was because they would be inconvenienced themselves if he didn't drive and because he's a big, scary looking guy and loses his temper if criticized. I'm not even that close to him, so I know it's out of line for me to do it- but who else will? I can't help it... I reminded him the chances were good he'll get thrown in jail when he inevitably gets pulled over for a defect or just a breath test. Worst case- and also probable- no insurance is covering him if he injures someone or damages another car etc. Sure enough, he hated me for telling him and it made no difference anyway- he didn't change anything and the dude is now in prison... what a fkn suprise.\nIt's not always so serious though- I enjoy chiming in for more trivial events too- like telling my wife the shitty plastic her food was heating on in the microwave is a bad idea. Or at dinner I told her shes filled our toddlers drinking cup up too high and he'll likely spill it everywhere (he did). And don’t start me when i’m in a room with religious people....These kinds of things happen multiple times every day and I know im raining on peoples parades but the thing is, I cannot, with good conscience, sit back and just let people 'learn the hard way', when I might have had the chance to intervene before the fact. \nIf I kept nagging about the same thing over and over, sure, I deserve a punch, but I gently nudge just one time and drop it. I don’t understand why people wouldn’t want me to do this. Btw, I certainly don’t do this as a ‘told you so’, ego-stroking excercise, as everyone i know thinks im as annoying AF and all my friends have dropped off- I assume this is why..\n\nSo? Is this the trait of someone that's honest and genuinely cares about the well-being of others (as intended), or am I a first -class irritating asshole? \n\n\nTl;dr?... look, I already edited the shit out of this, so I don't feel good about leaving the Cliff notes with no context, because I couldn't hold your attention an extra 3 minutes to read the thing -sorry\n",

      "description": "So this is more of a question of if we are the assholes, since there are multiple people on my side. If we sound like dumb college kids with a shit sense of humor, it's because we totally are. No reason to deny it.\n\nWe have a small group that goes to trivia at a local bar every week, and we like to change our team name around just to keep it interesting. So one of our teammates and I decided that we should pick out something stupid and \"punny\", like one of those names that Bart makes Moe call out to the bar, since whatever we pick has to be read aloud from our sign up sheet. For context, I know the people who own the bar and I knew that the person reading it out would think it was hilarious.\n\nWe came up with a ton of extremely stupid names, mostly middle school level jokes like \"Iva Biggun\" and \"Seymour Buttz\", but one person in our group seemed genuinely upset about it, despite the rest of us loving the idea and laughing like idiots over every name. She basically said she refused to play with us if we picked anything even a little bit inappropriate because she didn't want to be associated with it, as though anyone in a bar is going to care past the initial laugh of having \"Ivana Tinkle\" read out loud. The owner of the bar was totally in on it too, he offered up \"cordon blue balls\", which the girl also got upset about, but the rest of us loved. Seriously regret not taking that name.\n\nI felt bad about making her uncomfortable, but I think that she needs to loosen up a little. It's just a stupid name for a trivia team that would probably end up changed next week anyway. I don't want to call her TA, because she's genuinely a very sweet person, she's just super uptight about anything related to nsfw topics, while me and the others are really loose about it. We just wanted to have fun and get a laugh out of the other teams.\n\nSo are my other teammates and I assholes for trying to push for a name she wouldn't like?\n\nTldr; Everyone on trivia team wants an inappropriate pun for our team name except one person, who threatens not to play if we go with one.",

The other day a woman approached me there and started making small talk and we got to chatting fairly well. She was clearly flirting and I was interested at first, but she said \"you can buy me a drink if you want\" and I started laughing because it seemed so presumptuous. She must have thought I was playing around because we went back to talking and she invited me out for dinner the next night and I agreed.\n\nWe went to dinner and talked more and everything was going well until it came time to pay. The bills came and she didn't even reach for her wallet once, just looked at me expecting something. I told the server two bills and paid for my own and she just kind of stared at me then paid for her own. When we went our own ways I texted her and told her I didn't want a second date.\n\nIt put me off that her initial idea of flirting is by suggesting I buy her something, it didn't come across as if she seen us as equals, almost like I was expected to impress her even though it was her who approached me. Then when we went to dinner even though she invited me she expected me to pay automatically instead of splitting. She is otherwise very polite but it came across as very entitled like I had to pay for the privilege of her time or I'm expected to put her on a pedestal. It made me feel like she thought she was better than me. My friends say I am being an asshole, and so did she when I told her no second date. AITA?",

      "description": "For context, this was my first appointment with him and this happened a few hours ago. Lately my eyesight's been going blurry on-and-off and I've been getting some nasty headaches here and there. He thought my eyesight is fine but instead I just suffer from migraines in general. He started listing off certain things that could cause someone to be more prone to migraines, one of which being drugs. I'm 16 now, and I've never touched drugs or had a sip of alcohol but he kept pushing drugs more than anything else he was talking about.\n\nHe was very clearly one of those old-fashioned folk, he kept starting all his lines with \"This generation always *this*\" and \"This generation always *that*.\" (He's 72 to clear that up) Some of the things that he said were things like bad food choices, genetics (familial history of migraines), screen addiction, drugs, obesity. \n\nHe kept trying to talk to me, something that I somewhat found annoying but not enough for me to lash out. He asked me what I thought about Donald Trump and frowned when I said I didn't mind him (don't bother me about this please). In general he seemed super stubborn about his ideologies and thoughts and whatever he thought was right.\n\nOne line he said that really got me was \"So maybe you shouldn't do any more drugs if you want to keep the migraines from getting worse.\"\n\nAfter that I said  \"Do you think I'm doing drugs?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that, I'm saying your generation is more likely to suffer from migraines because of your higher drug use.\"\n\nMy mom intervened before it could go any further and she apologized for my behavior and then berated me as we drove home. He didn't say much after I said that before saying I should get some glasses that could make migraines easier to deal with. \n\nI do somewhat feel bad but I don't think I did anything wrong, it was moreso my mom guilting me into thinking I did something wrong.

While we usually get along okay, we are both sometimes very stubborn people. I know from experience that my mom will absolutely not back down on even the smallest disagreements. \n\n\n\nShe told me earlier that she didn’t want me to shave my arms. I listen to my mom and I obey her every single day. I’ll make dinner when she tells me to, I’ll clean when she tells me to, I keep up with my studies and I am generally honest and respectful to her. But for me this was going too far because it’s my body and shaving my arms will have 0 impact on my future. \n\nI told her that I shave my arms to feel more comfortable with myself. She accused me of wanting to conform to society, and that “God” created me so that I can be myself. I replied back asking if that was the case, then why does my mom always wax her eyebrows and pluck her unwanted facial hair. She told me facial hair is okay but arm hair isn’t. I asked her why since their the same thing. \n\nIt went back and forth like that for a long time and things got really heated. She told me that I’m an ungrateful daughter and I never listen to anything she said, she said in the future I’ll be drinking and smoking and going completely off the rail. \n\nI understand her argument. Her house, her rules. But I feel like as a mother she rarely ever takes my interests into heart. She’s happy and complacent whenever I tell her about my achievements but she’ll never go out of her way to let me have something that would make ME happy. With her it’s always like, what would SHE want, what would SHE like to be happy, and it’s so exhausting that I wish for once she’d let me have one thing I want that isn’t necessary or that she feels obligated to do as a parent. \n\nSo AITA? Should I obey her or assert my own boundaries? \n\nThank you so much in advance. ",

      "description": "WIBTA? For clarity, I am kind of a people pleaser. I have struggled with self love for a while and I don't know if this would make me a bad person. There's a girl named Sydnie. She hasn't been friends with me for a while for a few reasons. I stood up for an ex she was constantly talking bad about, and she even had people join in and bash him as a group. Anyway, she took upon talking to me (very rarely) and would show basic manners and talk to me about some school related issues. Today she decided to hand me an invitation. She had organized a surprise birthday party for a mutual friend. The mutual friend's birthday was on December 12th. Since they wouldn't be able to celebrate during the week, Sydnie must have decided to do it during the weekend. I thought it sounded kind of fun until I looked at the date and my heart sank. She scheduled it for the 16th, which is my birthday. I felt very malcontent with everything and decided I'd rather not go. I felt like she was basically trying to ignore my birthday and just act like a jerk. I saw her after class, talked to her and told her that I might not be able to go. She said \"okay\" and then walked away. Do you think that I'm the asshole for deciding not to go? Given, I would go if it were a mutual celebration. \n\n\nTLDR: A girl who treated me badly invited me to a friend's party since it couldn't be celebrated on weekday. I don't feel like going to the party because it's on my birthday",

      "description": "So this is a situation that has been going on for years and I really don't know what to do about it anymore or if I have been handling it well or not, some people have told me I'm a bad friend and some people have told me I should just walk away but that's why I want to ask you guys what you think.\n\nSo I met this guy online around five years ago, at the time I was really depressed, living on a bad home and experiencing PTSD from a previous abusive relationship. I liked this guy and after talking regurlaly for a while we started dating, which only lasted a couple moths. I honestly liked him more as a friend and broke up, but durying this time I dropped my last year of highschool since I was experiencing a lot of anxiety attacks in class due to my PTSD. He wasn't happy with highschool either so he dropped off as well. I finished highschool after taking a break for a year and got help from a therapyst, he didn't.\n\nEver since he has stayed at his mom's home, playing videogames all day, not even going outside his house and just constantly complaining about his life being terrible and being horribly depressed. For five years of friendship I've listened to his problems and to his depressive thoughts and tried to give him advice, cheer him up and telling him that if he tries hard enough to maybe finish highschool or get a job he can solve his problems. He just keeps using being depressed as an excuse to even go out of his house. \n\nAfter some point these went from talks to just arguments, and since then he argues with everyone about anything, if someone doesn't agree with him about something he will argue about it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago my boyfriend and I tried to play something with him but almost as soon as the call started, he started to argue with my boyfriend about the new Steam chat update??? since then we agreed to not invite him to play with us anymore.\n\nTonight I decided to play with him because he said he needed someone to distract him from his depressive thoughts, even though I had just woken from a nap after having a wonderful day I said yes. After a while of just playing and talking about things it happened again, he brought up being sad and we had yet another argument about him hating his life and me encourage him to do something to make it better, at some point my game crashed and I said that I wanted to go to bed. He got upset because I wouldn't stay up with him and I just said ''You know, you being like this doesn't help me want to stay up with you at all'', he said that he knows and we just said goodnight.\n\nI feel bad for pushing him away for being depressed but at the same time I've been trying to help him out with this for years now and he has still done nothing to get better.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I recently posted about this is in a relationship advice subreddit but the post was seen by someone who recognized some of the details so I took it down. What are the odds? Anon for privacy sake.\n\nFiance and I been together for 2 years, engaged for a few months. I love his family and they all seem to return the affection - except for his mom. His mom had set him up with her neighbor/close (younger) friend prior to our deciding to date exclusively and he ended it with the neighbor/friend when things got serious between us. Mom, however, can't seem to accept it and for the past year has continued to work her neighbor into conversation at least once EVERY SINGLE TIME we speak to or see her. The last time it was to relay a \"Merry Christmas\" message from the girl - albeit in code this time. Whereas she usually uses her first name she went with \"(insert first initial, last name) said to wish you a Merry Christmas and tell you she wishes you well\" while knowingly on speaker. Mind you at this point, we had been staying at her house to cat sit for her for 3 fucking weeks to help her out, so I'm assuming she knew she was being an asshole but couldn't fully resist. \n\nThat last time was the final straw for me. Something about the coded reference did it. In the past I've chosen to ignore it - she once called the girl from my couch in our home, on speaker and I breathed through the disrespect and let it go. I get mad, vent to the fiance about the disrespect and then drop it. I'm not a person who can stay mad and have never been capable of holding a grudge and I've chosen for my own happiness to ignore it and play nice. She's entitled to her feelings and I get to some degree that she'd prefer her son marry a woman she has known for years and is very close to. But the disrespect is so blatant and I don't feel like I should have to tolerate it anymore. \n\nWe're supposed to be going to his moms house for the holidays and I've let him know I'm not going and that I'm done putting forth effort where his mom is concerned. I will never be disrespectful or rude (and he knows it's not my style to be). She would have no idea that I've thrown in the towel, I just refuse to inconvenience myself soley to make her happy anymore when she can't even give me the respect of a single conversation without bringing the \"ex\" up. And going to her house for another couple days after being gone from ours for so long to help her out would be inconvenient to me. He's upset and feels like it's not right on my part and makes excuses for his mom, ad nauseum. He says he gets it and agrees that it's disrespectful but rather than support my decision he's chosen to argue that I'm being an asshole and says it's not fair of me to not be willing to see her for Christmas. We're currently not even speaking because we can't seem to reconcile the difference. So as not to offend by the no show, I've told him we can go with me being sick. Going forward, we will absolutely see her but I will no longer be openly suggesting get togethers nor doing the things I've done in the past like send her pics and keep open dialogue (which she often ignores) and encouraging him to reach out to her. He's on his own there. \n\nAm I the asshole, Reddit? ",

I honestly feel very bad about the way I act, but he’s adamant that I’m not an AH, I’m just a jerk/mean when I criticize him.\n\nI tend to be very afraid on the roads because of a childhood experience that very easily could’ve killed me and my mom (thanks, dad) and I’ve expressed that to him, but I just can’t get him to realize that HE’S the bad driver. For instance, he was driving today and braked hard because the driver in front of us - in his words - “braked too hard for some reason.” We weren’t even on the highway, it wasn’t that busy of a road, and yet he was RIGHT BEHIND THE GUY for no good reason and the guy in front barely braked to make a turn!\n\nI snapped and said “if you weren’t tailgating the fuckin’ guy you wouldn’t have had to brake like that!” He went quiet, and I continued: “Drive like this by yourself, not with me.” (My tone was definitely very attacking - wasn’t the most constructive way to criticize it.) He went quiet for the next few minutes until I apologized.\n\nOn the highway, we live in a very populated city so it can be VERY chaotic - but he drives so aggressively and fast and nearly rear ended 3 (!) people and I honestly screamed at him a couple times because he wouldn’t stop putting us in bad situations like that. He always makes excuses for his driving, won’t admit when he’s wrong, and I don’t feel very safe, but I also know I can be intense. Is it bad to criticize his driving so much? Is there a better way to get him to stop driving like a jerk? AITA?",

      "description": "My friend and i were fooling around during a break at school, and we were having a bit too much fun. Long story short he ended up tackling me and i landed on the ground facing up. My backpack was on my back at this time, and i didnt notice the broken computer untio my next class. When i arrived and opened my computer, the screen was obliterated. Not physically cracked but some board in the screen definitely broke. I had previously broken another computer (owned by the school as well, but we had insurace. so repairs were free). I figured that logically, the fall broke it, so I'd tell my friend he broke my computer and we'd get it fixed without any issue.\n\n\n\nSo, later i approach my friend and tell him about the incident. I show him the computer and he says \"You don't have any proof that the fall broke it\" and he said he wouldnt pay for the repairs. He later said that \"(my name) I hope you realise I did nothing wrong I guess karmas a bitch\" (exact words). \n\nSide Note: The computer was quite old, so repairs would most likely be purchasing a whooe new computer.",

Occasionally I'll make some kind of noise at a line of dialogue, which makes her curious. When she'd ask why I made the noise I would just say that it's a spoiler. She would ask me about it but I would keep my mouth shut since I generally don't like spoiling movies and shows and such. This would usually lead to her insisting on me telling her, but I would keep refusing. This mostly ends in an argument.\n\nTl;dr, should I just tell people spoilers when they ask for them?",

      "description": "For a bit of context and back story, I'm a single bisexual guy and live in a studio apartment on the third floor of my apartment complex, rent is cheap, or at least low enough to allow me a significant amount of disposable income. I share my place with my two dogs, whom I walk often when I'm there and whenever they need to run downstairs to do their needs when I'm home. Needless to say the place is slightly cramped between me and my old puppers. On tje nights I work, I allow one.of the neighbors to keep them(pay them fairly of course even if sometimes I need to convince them to accept tje money)  and sometimes I go to my sister's place and drop them off for the night or a day or two so they see mother, my sister and her kids. They love it. \nI've been doing this since I moved out back in 2011 at the age of 19.\nI know it seems odd I don't have a place of my own at my age now, but for reasons I can't disclose, let's say I'm not eligible for land ownership of any kind at the moment. \nAnywho, back when I moved out I focused on college for a while to pursue a career in the medical field but dropped it once I realized I would not be able to practice said career if I were to go through with it(at least at the time)... So instead settled for becoming an rn(registered nurse) and decided to leave things at that. \nDuring those college years I met a group of friends, we all shared similar interests, but also differing beliefs and opinions, and some of us stood in different sides of the political spectrum which often led to.minor argumemts.\nWe all are in a private but local messaging group, and back in early 2017 I met the person I'm referring to in the title. Now, full disclosure, that private server has a lot of nsfw content in it, and by that I mean nudes, videos and what not... And that's pretty much how I met said person who I will refer to as x from now on. \nX was 18? I think, maybe 19?, we all needed to be 18 to go tp the group parties.\n\nOne time back in  mid 2017 X was at a party the group owner was hosting, so was I and a few other close friends, along with a good amount of other people. I talked to X for a while, played videogames with him and thought it was a good interaction.\nNeedless to say once it got dark the party turned sexual and that was my queue to leave. \nX stayed behind, but we kept talking over text. We talked every day after that and got close enough for him to start venting and telling me all he.was going through. \nWe kept talking for a few months and kept seeing esch other at parties, as usual whenever the party went from games and movies to pretty much free for all orgy time I'd take my leave.\nOn the group, pictures and videos of X kept getting posted by him and the people he'd hook up with, to the point X was now known as the group's sex toy.\nWhich I didn't care for the most part, his life and decisions were his alone after all.\nThat kind of changed when X opened up to having problems with the relatives he stayed with because of parental issues. He'd bring up how he was basically homeless and couch surfing and that he had to stay with friends here and there and certain people from the group. \nIn August 2017 I offered him to stay at my place when he needed to from there on, which was sometimes several days at the time. \nIt was alright, at first that is. I'd end up driving him around, to doctor appointments and to his lgbt support group. I'd then take him to the next person he'd be staying with for the next set of days. Most of these were 50 minutes to and from, which sometimes made me question my own words when I ordered to help him out.\nIt soon became a routine where he'd just stay with me and a few other people in.the group. Mostly the guys and a very liberal couple.\nHe was very clean, and would clean the studio very well, far more than I did if I had to be honest. He would also cook for me in the mornings after I came home from work, so that was nice I suppose.\n\nHe'd lounge about in female lingerie or dressed. overly femenine and offer sex favors now and then, but I'd refuse them out of slight prejudice and slight disgust because of THE AGE GAP MIND YOU, not to mention his sex partners count was hundreds of times higher than mine, and there was also the issue of me taking him to get tested way too often, but probably him being poly had a major role in my decision not to accept. He.was quite good looking, I suppose. Very androgynous.\n\nI knew he let the other guys sex him when he stayed with them, but I wasn't interested in any of that, and also saw it to be wrong and almost as if it was taking advantage of his situation if I accepted the offers.\n\nOne thing I didn't mention was, he had no job, and while I was raised to never argue over food and water, and while he'd try and ask me to use his aid stamps, I simply didn't see it to be right to use them and instead let him use them with the others. However, what I did mind was... That he had no interest in finding a job, or a permanent place to stay or call his own. \nI'd take him to pick up applications close by, even offered to put in word with one of the many nursing places I'd worked and volunteered since highschool. But he'd often say how he wasn't cut out to work in general and that if he could fimd someone to stay and pay with sex and cleaning he'd be happy. \nEvery now and then I'd find the applications unfilled or folded, and when asked about it he'd respond with a simple I'm sorry I'll try later.\n \nThis went on between late 2017 and the entirety of 2018.\nLast November, he was offered access into an lgbt program that would let him have his owm apartment and job opportunities, but... He refused on the basis that it wouldn't let him be free to do things he liked, such as smoking and vaping weed, having to dress appropriately for job interviews as well as having to.be at the place every day by a certain time and no guests over night... So no sex life or so he complained. \nI was livid. I couldn't fathom why he'd let go such an opportunity. Even if it had drawbacks, just acceot it, make the most of it and when you are economically stable enough just move again.\nIt's not like it was any different from living witg me, no people over on days I work, and while I'm ok with drugs, I did ask not to have any at my place, the last thing I needed was to get jailed for possession of drug paraphernalia. \n\nI wanted to say something, but everyone in the group kept congratulating him and spoiling him. Specially the liberal couple that kept saying how brave he was and went as far as taking him to get new clothes right after. \nDecember and January go by and things are back to.the same routine, but I was just tired of him, of his attitude towards his situation. Of him caring more about a good fuck and dressing as a girl instead of fixing his situation.\nThey were enabling him. I was enabling the behavior and instead of helping him I was just making things worse for him at this point. \n\nI stopped doing things and took him in when I could, provided him food, internet and electricity. I never once asked of him more than I saw fit, never saw him in a sexual manner and was accepting of his kinks and sex life. \nHe was offered a part time job early January, but he declined it because he didn't like the hours... I asked him to reconsider but that went nowhere. \nI was really saddened by it and things were awkward for a few days until he stayed with someone else. He posted pictures of him partying and having sex in the group, petty normal behavior for him, but it made me boil with anger. He was acting like usual despite his situation. \nI texted him.I couldn't let him stay over anymore, and that he was welcome to come and pick his things up, which he did. He didn't make a scene or anything when he came over, did try and offer sex again, but he knew my stance on that kind of thing. \nLater I found myself uninvited to the upcoming dnd group gathering and parties, and the friends I had have blocked me.\nSo now I'm here writing this at 5:50am, still saddened the friends I thought I had are now just acquaintances or maybe less than so from the looks of it.  \n\nThere were many things I would have said, but they lean on politics and I don't feel like bringing those up. Though I feel they'd bring some more context to the situation.\n\nTL;DR\nLet \"homeless\" friend stay with me on and off for a little over a year. Friend never bother to better himself despite my efforts. Circle of friends encouraged his behavior and I had enough. Told him he couldn't stay with me anymore and now I've been pushed out of my circle of friends.",

I adore my kids and have a great rapport with them however ..... they are still kids (16yo). \n \nMS:Mad Student\nMe: Me\nThis morning one of them was complaining about homework so I laughed and say \"oh quit being a brat and just get it done\" and just keep on dealing with the 20 other kids turning it in. Maybe about 30seconds later he says...\n\nMS: \"Hold on! WHAT did you call me?.... Did you called me a brat?!\"\n\nMe: I looked at him kinda confused  \"yeahhh\" \n\nMS: \"That's messed up! If I was being disrespectful fine but YOU are being disrespectful by calling me names like that\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry if you felt I disrespected you....those weren't my intentions. I meant it playfully not mean\"\n\nMS: \"How would you feel if I called you the B word??\"\n\n-Other students joined in saying for him to calm down and it's not the same\n\nMS: very stern at them \"Y'all shut up! This doesn't concern you!\" \n\nMe: \"Whoa I don't feel like thats the same level. Again, I didn't mean to offend you. If you took it that way I apologize. I'd never purposely offend any of y'all. Actually I have the habit of calling my little sister a brat ... and she's my favorite person in the world. I don't see it as a \"bad word\" but if you see it as such... I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk like that to a student.\"\n\nHe seems to have accepted my apology but I really feel like am the asshole.

      "description": "AITA for getting annoyed/being offended by my boyfriends comments.\n\nContext - whenever we watch a show or movie, if there is an average or above girl he ALWAYS has to comment on their looks. At times he will make even more dramatic comments such as “if you were dating someone that good looking you must know if you broke up she’d be able to move on so fast” which feels like an absolute slap in the face. \n\nHe will also make comments like “ohhhhh” or “mmmm” if he sees a good looking girl on television. I get it, I get it, this is something you’d do with your mates but seriously, when it’s just him and I - it seems so unnecessary! He even occasionally goes as far as going to their Instagram and scrolling for 20 minutes or so through their pictures (this is on the computer which is hooked up to the tv so I have to watch). \n\nI’m totally open to the fact that I could be way to sensitive and if so I want to know. I just would think that if someone really loved you and cared about your feelings they might not be so quick to offend you. I’ve told him before that it feels like a slap in the face and hurts but he just keeps doing it. ",

      "description": "This is on mobile so please forgive formatting issues.\n\nA few months ago I went from a very active job to a desk job and put on a little weight. I haven't been really happy with this so a few weeks ago I started going to a gym and meeting with a personal trainer.\n\nIt was going great until the gym changed its rules on how many clients a personal trainer had to take to train at this gym. From what I've heard it's hard for them to keep up and there is no shortage of people wanting to work with trainers, hence why they have become more demanding with numbers.\n\nThe issue I'm having is I pay for one on one training with G. It's been going really well and I am losing weight but after the gym changed it's rules, she is double booking/triple booking her time slots. My time slot is a popular one and so for 3 sessions now I have had to work out with 2 older women (late 50's early 60's) who simply cannot keep up with someone who's 21. I feel like I'm losing momentum in my work out as I spend a lot of time standing around waiting for them. I have asked G to move me on without them but she refuses because she doesn't want to explain the same thing twice.\n\nWIBTA if I asked G to not double book my time slot and/or book me with someone more my speed? WIBTA if I went to the gym and asked for a different trainer if she refuses?\n\nTd;lr WIBTA for not wanting to share my one on one time with a personal trainer with older woman who can't keep up with me?

She was going on about my hair, etc, and grilling me for not responding and roasting her. I said \"what's up with your flat ass nose, then?\" and she laughed. Then she said \"it's because I'm black, right?\" (still laughing, etc) and I said \"damn straight, can't believe you pulled the race card on me\".\n\nThen she went silent and told me that I turned down a road I can't back up on. She hung up so I texted her that I was sorry and that I absolutely didn't mean to offend her but she told me that ignorance wasn't an excuse and we haven't spoken since.\n\nLiterally got no idea what I did wrong.",
